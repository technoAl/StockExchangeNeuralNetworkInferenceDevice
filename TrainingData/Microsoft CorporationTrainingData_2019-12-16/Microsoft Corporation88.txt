As it stands, they can force a tie for seventh place and battle in a playoff for the 8th seed."Big win for us," said Rain or Shine coach Caloy Garcia after the game. "Whatever happens, we showed heart today. We were able to beat a strong team, and that's a testament to the hard work of the locals.""Having (import) Rich (Ross) with the team changed a lot of things, and sayang -- sana maaga siya dumating," he added. "You can see that he's a winner, he wants to win."A win by Meralco would have knocked out the Elasto Painters from playoff contention, and the game appeared headed for that result after the Bolts took a 69-60 lead after three quarters.Ross, however, refused to let that happen. He anchored an 11-0 blast to open the final period, giving the Elasto Painters a 71-69 lead with 6:22 left.It was a tight game from there, with Meralco's Allen Durham knotting the count before a jumper by Ross gave the Elasto Painters gave the lead for good, 73-71, with 5:49 left.Nambatac drilled a booming triple with 4:19 to go for a 77-71 spread, and answered a Chris Newsome layup with a bucket of his own to maintain a 6-point advantage for ROS, 79-73.Meralco came to within two points, 79-77, off a Raymond Almazan putback before Norbert Torres' split at the line made it a three-point game.The E-Painters dodged a bullet when Durham bricked two charities with 1:50 to go, and Nambatac again came through when he lofted a floater over Durham for an 82-77 lead with 1:28 remaining.Meralco threatened anew when Almazan's putback of a miss by Newsome made it a one-point game, 82-81. They were still within distance, 83-81, after Jewel Ponferrada made just one of two charities.But out of a Meralco timeout, Nambatac came up with a big steal against Bong Quinto. The Bolts still had a chance when Durham blocked Ross on the other end and raced down the floor, but Almazan muffed his layup at the last second, allowing Rain or Shine to escape."Rey hit a big shot. We just have to hope for the next game," said Garcia, referring to the upcoming Ginebra-NorthPort game. A win by the Batang Pier will eliminate the Elasto Painters.Ross finished with 26 points and 12 rebounds, while Nambatac had 24 points on 10-of-13 shooting along with 4 assists and 3 rebounds.Squandered in the loss was a 23-point, 16-rebound output by Durham, and Almazan's 18-point, 19-rebound double-double.The Bolts finished the elimination round with an 8-3 record. They are already assured of a twice-to-beat advantage in the quarterfinals.The scores:Rain or Shine 83 - Ross 26, Nambatac 24, Exciminiano 8, Borboran 4, Ponferada 4, Mocon 4, Norwood 4, Rosales 3, Torres 3, Belga 3, Daquioag 0.Meralco 81 - Durham 23, Amer 18, Almazan 18, Newsome 12, Quinto 6, Pinto 2, Caram 2, Faundo 0, Hodge 0, Salva 0.Quarterscores: 23-21, 41-42, 60-69, 83-81.Share'Signs of life' in collapsed building but aftershocks stymie rescue opDecember 16, 2019Huling kabanata ng Skywalker saga ng Star Wars malapit nang mapanoodDecember 16, 2019Jollibee to open 1,200th store, first with 'dual-lane' drive thru, in PHDecember 16, 2019Lalaking nag-withdraw sa ATM hinoldap, pinatay sa QCDecember 16, 2019Meme for a cause: Bretman Rock donates portion of 'What Do You Meme' proceeds to fan battling cancerDecember 16, 2019Cesar Montano gets another crack at HollywoodDecember 16, 2019Phivolcs to quake survivors: Get your houses checked by engineersDecember 16, 2019Magnitude 6.9 na lindol, tumama sa MindanaoDecember 16, 2019PANOORIN: Bonggang fashion show kung saan pantay ang lahatDecember 16, 2019New Miss Universe Philippines pageant launches 2020 searchDecember 16, 2019PSEi slips despite US-China interim trade dealDecember 16, 2019'Meron ako tsismis': Dela Rosa says no confirmation yet on US visa cancellationDecember 16, 2019Senate OKs bill on separate facility for heinous crime convictsDecember 16, 2019Made in the Philippines: Ang kuwento sa likod ng signs sa jeepneyDecember 16, 20196 sasakyan inararo ng SUV sa Bulacan; 3 patayDecember 16, 2019Australia firefighters accidentally spread blaze ahead of heatwaveDecember 16, 2019SB19 concert tickets sell out in 3 minutesDecember 16, 2019New eats: Yani Café fosters community spirit in PasigDecember 16, 2019Duterte certifies as urgent bill on gov't workers' salary hikeDecember 16, 2019Maine Mendoza, mas bukas na sa relasyon kay ArjoDecember 16, 2019© 2019 ABS-CBN Corporation.
