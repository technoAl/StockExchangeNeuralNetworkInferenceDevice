Five days of impeachment inquiry hearings, held over the past two weeks, concluded Thursday. The public heard from 12 people who testified about President Donald Trump's efforts to strongarm a critical ally into delivering political dirt while holding up vital military aid and a White House meeting.House Democrats called these witnesses forward to help them make the case in the impeachment inquiry that the president abused his power by using his public office for private gain.The controversy at the heart of the investigation, dubbed "Ukrainegate" by some, broadly consists of four chapters:The dozen fact witnesses Congress heard from were able to speak to all of these in varying degrees.But four nonpartisan career diplomats and national security officials and one Trump-allied ambassador, in particular, stood out in helping Democrats make their entire case against the president.

The other eight witnesses also testified to key moments throughout the last several months that illustrate Trump's and his allies' agenda to force Ukraine to cave to his demands.David Holmes, Taylor's staffer who overheard the call, described his intense dismay at learning the aid to Ukraine was frozen and why. Fiona Hill, the NSC's former top Russia analyst, gave scathing testimony in which she said she refused to go along with the "fictional narrative" Trump was pushing about Ukrainian election interference.George Kent, a senior State Department official, blew a hole through all of Trump's beliefs about the Bidens' corruption and Ukraine's purported election meddling.Volker, State Department official David Hale, and former NSC official Tim Morrison, were on the GOP's witness list and their testimony ended up doing more to hurt the party's position than help it.But as far as cementing the Democrats' case against Trump, the testimony of Vindman, Taylor, Sondland, Cooper, and Yovanovitch drove the story home.
