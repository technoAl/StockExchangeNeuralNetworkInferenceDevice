Filed under:Predicting the winners of this week’s football games.The Bleeding Green Nation writers picks are in for Week 13 of the 2019 NFL regular season! Every week we’ll predict the winners of all the games on the schedule. We’ll tally the results along the way and see who comes out on top at the end of the season.After Week 12, Benjamin Solak and John Stolnis are tied for the lead but it’s still a very tight race down the stretch.The BGN staff obviously likes the Philadelphia Eagles to beat the Miami Dolphins this week. The Eagles’ recent struggles pale in comparison to the Dolphins’ issues. The BGN staff also mostly likes the Dallas Cowboys to beat the Buffalo Bills on Thanksgiving, unfortunately. Feel free to post your own predictions or discuss the writer predictions in the comments. You can also vote for who you think will win the games. I’ll tally those results in a “BGN Community” column.
