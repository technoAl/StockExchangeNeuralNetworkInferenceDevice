Jeremy Corbyn has a surprise for you. But it's not at all what you're thinking.On Election Day in the UK, the Labour Party leader tweeted that he'd been informed "personal images" from his past had been sent to the media and would be published. "Here's the truth," he wrote, and posted a bit.ly link alongside it. Obviously, I clicked. And I bet you did too. The link, however, didn't take people to a page explaining these "personal images" but instead directed them to a polling station locator site. I have been informed that personal images from my past have been sent to some media outlets and are set to be released today.Here's the truth: https://t.co/XtvzZdb8oy— Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) December 12, 2019Here's a screenshot of where the link will take you:
