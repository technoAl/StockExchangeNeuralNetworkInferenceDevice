Trends and technologies may come and go, but annoying relatives are timeless.In this exclusive clip from Little Women, ambitious protagonist Jo (Saoirse Ronan) gets some unsolicited advice about her future from Aunt March (Meryl Streep) — never mind that it's advice she herself never took. It's a moment that should feel especially familiar right around the holidays, which are nothing if not excuses for your extended family to gather around and ask you when you're getting a "real" job, or why you and your girlfriend haven't gotten engaged yet, or if you're really sure you don't want to move back to your hometown, or et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Thank you, Meryl, for immortalizing that meddling aunt energy in Little Women, out in theaters Dec. 25. 'Saturday Night Live' ruined Baby YodaBoth sides of the Trump coin are skewered in a sharp 'SNL' cold openHere's what Apple's $6,000 cheese grater Mac Pro looks like on the inside'Saturday Night Live' retells a joke from two years ago and it still isn't funny
