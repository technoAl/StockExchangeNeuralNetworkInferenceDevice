I'm currently using my pixel 3 and was thinking to upgrade to the 4 but with so many reviews saying it wasn't worth the price I started looking at the unlocked Note 10. Now that the pixels price is dropping do you think it now makes it a better option over the Note 10?I already have the pixel 4 XL, but also getting the Note 10 again during black Friday sale. I have $150 Microsoft store coupon in addition to $200 off black Friday sale and $600 trade in for pixel 3 XL. I'll pick up an used pixel 3 XL locally for around $400 and will trade that in.
If you have trade in then Note 10 will be much cheaper and since you say you don't care about updates etc, then...I've had my S9 for 20 months and am tired of Samsung so I ordered a 128gb White Pixel 4 XL today from Best Buy. $300 off plus $150 trade in.What about you? Do you plan on buying an Android phone during Black Friday?Join the conversation in the forums!
