But a few days after the launch, some scientists expressed concerns.Alex Parker, an astronomer, highlighted on Twitter that there was a risk that the light pollution could block our view of the stars.There were also concerns about Kessler syndrome, the theory that a vicious cycle of mounting space debris and the increased likelihood of satellite collisions could one day stop humans from accessing space for hundreds of years.
