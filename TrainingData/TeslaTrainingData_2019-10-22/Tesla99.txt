Elon Musk said he would look into launching a "drive thru mode" on Teslas after a customer complained on Twitter that the car "beeped like crazy" every time she went to make her order. A customer reached out to Musk on Twitter on Wednesday to raise her concerns about the oversensitivity of parking sensors on her Tesla car while driving it through a drive-thru. "Can we get a drive thru mode please? It beeps like crazy every time I'm trying to get my chicken sandwich (; thank you!" she wrote.  Musk responded to her query with an affirmative: "Looking into it." Musk has previously used Twitter to ask customers about features they would like to see in new Tesla models.  He announced on Tuesday that Tesla would unveil a new "Cybertruck" model on November 21 in Los Angeles.Last year, he listed some features of the new vehicle, including automatic parallel parking, 360-degree cameras, and sonar.
