Brace yourself for the most epic Target run of the year.The retailer has released its 2019 Black Friday ad scan, announcing exclusive deals on gaming bundles, smart home devices, Dyson vacuums, an Instant Pot, and even the newest iPhone and Samsung Galaxy models. It is, as the kids say, extremely lit.All of Target's Black Friday deals will be available Thanksgiving morning (Nov. 28) on Target.com, according to a press release, so if you plan on becoming one with your couch after eating too many mashed potatoes, that's cool. But if you want to be a part of the action, be sure to set your alarm for 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day — that's when its stores are scheduled to open. You'll have until 1 a.m. on Black Friday to shop your heart out, and then things will pick back up again at 7 a.m.If you can't wait 'til then, you can shop some of Target's holiday deals during its Black Friday Preview Sale this weekend (Friday, Nov. 8 through Saturday, Nov. 9) in stores and online. RedCard holders will also have the opportunity to snag more than 100 deals before everyone else as part of an all-day Early Access Sale on Wednesday, Nov. 27 on Target.com, so if you've been thinking about becoming a cardholder, now's the perfect time.Aside from Dell, Target is the first major retailer to drop its Black Friday ad this year — and honestly, it's going to be hard for places like Walmart, Costco, and Best Buy to beat some of its doorbusters.
