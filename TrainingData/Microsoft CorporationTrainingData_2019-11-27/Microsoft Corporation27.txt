Plus, big Best Buy discounts on every iPad Pro.Amazon and B&H Photo now have the best price on the brand-new 10.2-inch iPad -- $299. It's far from the lowest price we've seen; that was Target's $230 Cyber Monday deal. But the current $30 discount is likely to be the best we can get expect from hereon out -- and it's a decent deal on an Apple product that's been on store shelves for not quite 90 days. Otherwise, the best Cyber Monday holdovers involve the iPad Pro. Best Buy is offering a $150 discount on every version of the 11-inch model and up to $200 off higher-capacity 12.9-inch models. At the moment, the 64GB 11-inch iPad Pro costs $650 and the 12.9-inch 64GB model costs $850 -- and we've got all of the links below.The discounts on the newer iPad Mini and iPad Air remain negligible. We'd recommend waiting for the next round of deals to come through before buying either one of them. And the discontinued 9.7-inch iPad seems to have now disappeared almost entirely. Note that we're focused on the Wi-Fi versions of the iPad here. Using LTE on a tablet is cool but, for most people, not worth the additional cost -- for the device and the monthly service -- especially when you can easily tether your phone for free.    Amazon and B&H Photo have the best prices on the 32GB model, $299. Amazon has a lock on the best deal on the 128GB model at $379.
