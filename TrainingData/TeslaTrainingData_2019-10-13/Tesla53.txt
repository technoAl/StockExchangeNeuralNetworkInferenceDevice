The single-layer battery also charges at a slightly reduced rate, maxing out at 225kW compared to 270kW for the double-layer 93kWh pack. As long as the battery is preheated and the state of charge is below 20 percent, both packs should reach 80 percent after 22.5 minutes connected to an 800V DC fast charger. Porsche says all Taycan 4S buyers will get 30 minute charging at Electrify America fast chargers free for three years, as well as free fast charging at Porsche dealers around the country. Like Audi, Porsche has partnered with Amazon to make the process of getting a home charger installed as painless as possible.With a much cheaper price tag, it's possible to see the Taycan 4S as a more direct competitor to the Tesla Model S, although that car will almost certainly outperform a Taycan 4S in terms of acceleration and range. But the pricing is in line with what Porsche charges for the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid—although as we found out in our drive last month, the experience of driving a Taycan is as different from driving a Panamera as it is from driving a Tesla.Listing image by PorscheYou must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.
