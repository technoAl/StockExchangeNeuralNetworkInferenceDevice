Tesla's upcoming electric pickup truck could be unveiled as soon as November, and internet is teeming with mockups showing what it could look like.Â The problem with those images (see examples here and here and here) is that they're nothing like the real thing, at least according to Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Â "Cybertruck doesnâ€™t look like anything Iâ€™ve seen bouncing around the Internet. Itâ€™s closer to an armored personnel carrier from the future," Musk tweeted Monday.Cybertruck doesnâ€™t look like anything Iâ€™ve seen bouncing around the Internet.

Yes, you can see next to nothing in that image, which allegedly depicts the front of the truck.Â There's a pickup somewhere in this image.Image:  TeslaMusk's new tweet spawned more guesses of what the pickup might look like, this time more in the vein of an armored personnel carrier type of vehicle, only futuristic.Â How close am I, your Lordship?On a scale from 0 (virgin) to 11 (ChadðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´)? pic.twitter.com/7o0SkMosdYâ€” Pope Of Muskanity v10 (@RationalEtienne) October 14, 2019pic.twitter.com/z12c5wEbuZâ€” Pope Of Muskanity v10 (@RationalEtienne) October 14, 2019Basic forms? pic.twitter.com/zcJGXd4JuKâ€” CHARLÏ’Îž (@Charly_Electric) October 14, 2019With the official reveal inching closer, we should find out what it really looks like soon enough. Other than it looking like it's from the future, we don't know much about the pickup's features, but Musk did say before that the price will likely start under $50,000.Â
