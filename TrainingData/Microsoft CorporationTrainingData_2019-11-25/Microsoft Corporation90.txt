Everyone wants to live in Boise, Idaho, right now.The midsize Pacific Northwest city is experiencing a major growth spurt. Forbes named it the fastest-growing city in the US in 2018. Its population grew by 18.2% from 2010 to 2018, and by more than 3% from 2017 to 2018.While most people moving to Boise come from smaller towns in Idaho, the foremost place that out-of-state transplants are moving from is California, primarily from the Los Angeles metro area.Almost 80,000 people moved to Idaho in 2018, and more than 21,000 of them were from California, according to US Census data.According to locals, people are finally figuring out how great of a place Boise is to live. In 2019, Boise was named the best place to live for millennials, as well as the best US city to buy a house.I recently spent four days in Boise exploring the city and talking to business owners and residents. As someone who lives in Brooklyn and works in Manhattan, I was curious to get a feel for Boise's downtown and see what kind of lifestyle it offers for big-city transplants. After four days, I can, for starters, say this: Boise does not disappoint.Keep reading for a look at its vibrant downtown area, which is bustling with breweries, farm-to-table restaurants, coffee shops, and new luxury apartments.Boise saw an 18.2% population jump from 2010 to 2018 and was the fastest-growing city in the country from 2017 to 2018, according to Forbes.Roughly 25% of out-of-state transplants in Boise came from California, followed by Washington, Utah, Oregon, and Texas, according to the Boise Valley Economic Partnership's marketing manager.While many welcome Boise's growth, some say the influx of new residents is pricing out longtime locals. The average home price in Boise jumped almost 12% from 2017 to 2018, and average rent has increased by roughly 7% in the past year. But wages haven't kept up, leaving many residents struggling to afford their living costs.Some also say the growth has brought with it big-city-like traffic.In New York City, the average commute is more than double Boise's, at 40.8 minutes. In San Francisco, it's 32.8 minutes.In 2019, Boise was named the best place to live for millennials, as well as the best US city to buy a house. And it has a burgeoning tech scene.I recently spent four days in Boise exploring downtown and other areas, interviewing business owners, and chatting with locals."In the last 10 years, Idaho's economy has become more diverse, which can easily be seen in the boom downtown," Wes Jost, the senior vice president and manager of Zions Bank's Idaho commercial-real-estate group, told me. "New people and businesses are continuing to relocate to Boise, placing our area in growth mode for the last six to seven years."That boom was clear during my visit.Boise is a city of just of 229,000 people, but throughout my time there, downtown was bustling with people walking and biking, grabbing a coffee in the plethora of trendy cafés, and even sitting outside in the sun on a brisk November day.I spotted several colorful murals in alleyways and on the sides of buildings.Boise has a Basque community of about 16,000, one of the largest in the US.The Basque people come from the western foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains on the border of Spain and France. They have their own distinct Basque language.On my last night in Boise, a Friday night, I stopped into Bardenay for a drink. Inside, I found a boisterous atmosphere, with people of all ages filling up the large space.I paid $7.50 for a tasty huckleberry lemon drop cocktail, which is made with "Bardenay lemon vodka, triple sec, fresh-pressed sweet & sour and handpicked Idaho huckleberry puree." And the price was a welcome relief from New York City, where cocktails can easily go for double that price.The restaurant-distillery serves a variety of dishes, from sandwiches and burgers to tacos and sea-bass gnocchi.One of the breweries, 10 Barrel Brewing Company, originates in Bend, Oregon, and opened its Boise location in 2013.Boise Brewing Company on Broad Street opened in 2014 and brews at least 14 beers — from blonde ales to stouts to IPAs — and one cider. It hosts trivia nights, live music, fundraisers, and "brewery yoga" on Sundays.Other local breweries include Barbarian Brewing, Payette Brewing Company, White Dog Brewing Company, and Woodland Empire Craft Ale.You can choose from more than 40 beers on tap, starting at $2 for a half-pint and $5 for a pint.Dave Krick, the owner, said he got lucky that he picked Bittercreek Alehouse's Eighth Street location back in the '90s. Today, Eighth Street is clearly one of the most happening streets in the area."I don't think I could've predicted the future of where we landed, but I just loved downtown Boise," he told me. "I loved Eighth Street 'cause I grew up down here and it's where I wanted to center my life. And lucky me, so did a lot of other people."The premise of his business was simple, he said: "I love beer. I wanted to make a place that people could come and discover good beer." He added that "in those days, it was much more of a geek thing than it is today."I stopped in for lunch one day and got the Huntsman burger, which comes with Gloucester cheddar and Stilton bleu cheese, pickle, onion, tomato, applewood smoked bacon, a side of house-cut organic Idaho potatoes, and a draft cider. (I'm not much of a beer person.)The burger was $15.50, which is certainly not the cheapest burger to be found in Boise, but it was perfectly juicy and worth every penny.It serves 20 ciders on tap, including Meriwether ciders and ciders from all around the world.I tried the $7 hot mulled cider, which was very effective in warming me up on a brisk November evening.On my last night in Boise, I went from the Bardenay distillery to Press & Pony, a dimly lit cocktail bar with a speakeasy vibe.My last stop of the night was the Spacebar Arcade, a retro underground bar where you can drink cheap beers while playing Pac-Man and pinball.On the same Main Street block are Cactus Bar, which claims to be the oldest bar in downtown Boise, and Pengilly's Saloon, which has $2 well drinks on Tuesdays.The river is surrounded by a 25-mile stretch of tree-lined trails called the Greenbelt.One morning I spent about half an hour strolling down the Greenbelt from my hotel to the heart of downtown, and I passed several joggers, cyclists, and people walking their dogs.I passed by an indoor cycling and yoga studio called UpCycle Studio, which has a kombucha and cold-brew bar.Also downtown is a Pivot Lifestyle and Fitness by KA, a fitness center founded by Kristin Armstrong, a local three-time Olympic gold medalist in women's cycling.There's also a Crunch Fitness west of downtown and a Pure Barre studio near the river.The city has a bike-rental program, but most people appeared to be riding their own bikes.Another common mode of transportation was electric scooter from two of the major companies, Bird and Lime.When it opened, the Whole Foods was seen as a competitor to the beloved Boise Co-Op just north of downtown.But the co-op seemed to be thriving when I visited — and in fact, it opened a second location in the Boise suburb of Meridian in 2015.The Fowler opened downtown in 2018."We get a mix of residents who are new to Boise and those relocating downtown from other parts of the city," Casey Lynch, the CEO of Roundhouse, the Fowler's developer, told me. "As a fast-growing city, we see people moving from all over California, Seattle, and other expensive coastal markets.""The condos are quite expensive, and that's led to a lot of new apartment projects with plenty more in the works," he said.In the Fowler, the average rent for a one-bedroom is just under $1,500 a month. That's about $500 more expensive than the median rent for a one-bedroom in Boise, $980, according to Zumper.More than 1,000 residential units are in the planning stages in downtown Boise, The Idaho Statesman reported in May.There are more than 20 coffee and tea shops downtown, according to the Downtown Boise Association.One of the places that epitomize this scene is Form & Function, a hip, minimalist coffee shop on the ground floor of the Fowler that opened in January 2018.Floor-to-ceiling windows let in plenty of sunshine.A local I met told me Flying M was considered a safe space for LBGTQ people.Some of the customers seemed to be friends meeting to catch up. Others appeared to be working on their laptops, and others still were just reading the newspaper over coffee.My latte and snickerdoodle cookie came out to less than $5, half the price of what most coffee shops in New York City would charge.Eater named it one of the 25 essential restaurants in Boise.It sits in the corner of the ground floor of the Fowler next to the Form & Function coffee shop.David and Lizzy Rex opened the Wylder after moving from Santa Monica, California, in 2017.I had dinner there one night and was surprised to find that the restaurant was packed on a Wednesday evening. It felt like a cool New York restaurant, except less crowded and also somehow cozier.I ordered the most popular menu item, according to Yelp: the honey-badger pizza, which costs $18 and comes with Italian sausage, ricotta, caramelized onions, and spicy honey. It was one of the best pizzas I've ever had.David, who used to spend summers in Idaho as a kid, told me the Wylder's pizza dough takes 48 hours to make and is made from the highest-quality flour and ingredients they can find.At the recommendation of several locals, I had breakfast there one morning. I'd been warned that the lines can be out the door and down the block. Even on a Thursday morning, I had to wait for almost 10 minutes before getting a seat at the end of the bar.I ordered a drip coffee and eggs Benedict with a side of home fries. The portion was surprisingly large, and the hollandaise sauce was rich and creamy.My meal would've come out to less than $15, but I didn't even get a chance to see my receipt, because the elderly man next to me — a Korean War veteran — ended up sneakily paying my bill after we chatted throughout the meal.Jelli CEO Mike Dougherty told me Boise was an alternative to the "high costs and sort of broken nature of some of the economics" in the Bay Area."One of the things that we noticed when we were looking at Boise was how we really enjoyed the downtown voices, specifically the culture there," Dougherty said. "It felt very progressive. There are tons of fun little farm-to-table restaurants, great coffee shops ... It reminded me a little of Austin maybe 10 years ago, or Portland, or something like that."Boise is the longtime home of Hewlett-Packard's imaging-and-printing group, which introduced the HP LaserJet printer.After registered nurse, the most in-demand occupation in Idaho is software engineer.I saw secondhand book shops, a healthy-dog-food store, a store that sells artisan roasted nuts, chocolate shop, clothing boutiques that sell clogs and Free People dresses, and chains like North Face and West Elm.Beyond the dynamic restaurants, bars, and shops, the people I encountered downtown were all incredibly friendly — almost "annoyingly friendly," as Krick, the Bittercreek owner, jokingly put it — and eager to chat.And it's worth noting that the mix of entertainment, dining, and wellness options is extremely well tailored to the millennial lifestyle, especially since downtown is so walkable. Plus, the prices I paid for coffees, meals, and drinks were all a welcome reprieve from NYC prices; the city's relative affordability is also a good fit, financially, for a generation as cost-conscious as millennials.Coming from New York City, I can certainly see the appeal of Boise: It's a manageable size, yet it has everything you need. And I don't think I've ever visited another city where the residents — perhaps partly because many of them came from big cities like Los Angeles and Seattle — are so unabashedly delighted to live there.
