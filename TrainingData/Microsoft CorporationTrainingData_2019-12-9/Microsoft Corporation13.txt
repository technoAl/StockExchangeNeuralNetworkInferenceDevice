If you don't know 9-year-old drummer Nandi Bushell already, you probably will soon. Despite her young age, the 9-year-old from Ipswich, England, has been posting drum covers to her YouTube channel for over two years. She's covered the likes of Beyoncé, Metallica, Joan Jett. Now, she's going viral for her recent cover of Nirvana's "In Bloom."She kills it, of course, beating the drums exactly like Dave Grohl, and letting loose with a few screams in between. And aside from her recent viral video, Bushell has been having quite the year. She got to rock out in a new Argos holiday ad, slaying the classic '80s hit "Don't You (Forget About Me)" by Simple Minds.Christmas dreams start here... #BookOfDreamshttps://t.co/0NsaCa6ZU9 pic.twitter.com/9wNjtaSTAh— Argos (@Argos_Online) November 1, 2019Earlier this year, she also got to meet and jam with legendary rocker Lenny Kravitz, who said he keeps up with her drumming videos on social media. Today I had the most beautiful experience playing with a young drummer I saw on Instagram named @Nandi_Bushell. You are inspiring and I look forward to seeing you shine in the future. Love and respect. pic.twitter.com/wR1b9rTaGJ— Lenny Kravitz (@LennyKravitz) June 12, 2019If praise from Lenny Kravitz isn't validation (not that she needs any), we don't know what is. Bushell looks like she's catching fire, and we can only assume that she's going to continue rocking the way she knows how. Rock on, kid.
