  Warren Buffett, the billionaire mogul who leads Berkshire  Hathaway, has been a longtime champion of value investing, which  involves buying stocks or companies that are trading for less  than they might be worth.   In his 2018 letter to shareholders, he wrote that he picks  investments by "calculating whether a portion of an attractive  business is worth more than its market price."     But while making major acquisitions has been a focus of Berkshire  Hathaway in the past, Buffett wrote that in 2019 Berkshire  Hathaway would likely expand its holdings of marketable equities  - which currently equal roughly $234 billion.   Buffett has a lot of resources to put into the stock market. At  the end of the third quarter, the company's earnings report  showed that its cash holdings had grown to   a record $128 billion, even as it repurchased $700 million of  its own stock. The cash pile has grown because Buffett hasn't    bought a company since 2016.  "Prices are sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term  prospects," he wrote. "We continue, nevertheless, to hope for an  elephant-sized acquisition."   But even less-than-elephant-sized acquisitions have stumped  Buffett as of late. He recently lost out on a bid for Tech Data  because he   refuses to participate in bidding wars.   Buffett bid $5 billion for Tech Data but wouldn't raise his  price after Apollo Management offered the company $5.14 billion.   While buying stocks as opposed to companies may present a  "disappointing reality" for Buffett, his stock holdings give  investors a window into what companies he sees as attractive.
