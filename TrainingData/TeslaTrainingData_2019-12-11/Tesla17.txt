Original Cast?!I'd be lying if I told you I didn't immediately drop everything else and click. But when I did, the shortened link didn't take me to a news article about upcoming adventure Harry Potter and the Last Thestral â€” it took me to the gov.uk page which allows people in the U.K. to register to vote in the country's next general election.Well played, sir. Well played.â€” Gwen C. Katz (@gwenckatz) November 25, 2019Yep: basically, if you want to vote in the general election on Dec. 12, the deadline to register is 11:59 p.m. on Nov. 26. Like many other celebrities and people across social media, Lewis was simply reminding people not to miss the deadline.Yes!!! Brilliant!!! Canâ€™t wait!!! Iâ€™m gonna start queuing up for tickets on December 12th! ðŸ˜ƒâ€” James (@JediAvenger10) November 25, 2019Lewis' tweet has since been shared over 11,000 times.
