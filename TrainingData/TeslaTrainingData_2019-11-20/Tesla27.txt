Original art photography by Leigh Merrill, a quilted headboard, Peace Industry felt rugs, and a Treko hand-loomed bed throws adorn rooms with warm detailing, complemented by graphical and geometric patterns.Those in need of a little more room can foot for a Double Queen room, bumping up to 450 sq. ft. of space, while the Founder’s Suite (shown below) extends accommodations to a generous 750 sq. ft., ample enough for its own master bedroom with en suite bathroom with a Sonoma Stoneworks cast tub and vanity, along with a queen-size pull-out sofa to host friends or family.Respectful of the natural beauty, the architectural efforts of David Baker Architects bear the award of LEED Gold Certification, with the entire property representing design intended to integrate, rather than intrude, with the surrounding landscape. A blessing, considering Healdsburg’s bucolic landscape is visible from every room, with the surrounding bevy of oenophile and culinary destinations the primary draws of this postcard perfect town.Furthering their green bona fides, the Harmon Guest House relies upon solar energy to heat water. A fleet of 26 bicycles are available for guests to use to explore town, with six electric vehicle-charging stations catering to Bay Area tech vacationers who’ve arrived by way of Tesla or other EV.While the property’s indoor meeting and special events facilities can capably accommodate up to 100 guests when needed, it’s the outdoor pool and rooftop areas that no doubt offer the bigger draw for informal socializing.A canopy of mature oak trees provide shade, privacy, and a sense of nature’s proximity around a solar heated pool.Inspired by and in honor of the town’s founder, Harmon Heald, the Harmon Guest House recently hosted Elevated Talks, inviting internationally-acclaimed professionals ranging from designers, architects, and musicians to discuss their work from the perspective of both the personal and professional (with this last 2019 event hosted and sponsored by Design Milk and Clever podcast).The rooftop bar and restaurant’s elevated perspective affords guests views of the Sonoma mountains in the distance and Downtown Healdsburg below.What: Harmon Guest House
