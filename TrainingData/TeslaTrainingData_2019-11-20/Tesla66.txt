After seven years since first announcing its intention to build a fully electric pickup truck, Tesla has finally unveiled its Cybertruck, a beast of a machine with an aesthetic largely reminiscent of a Mars rover.Available in three tiers — a single-motor RWD, a dual-motor 4WD, and a triple-motor 4WD — the new electric truck is clad in an ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless steel body that Elon Musk says is also used for his SpaceX starships, able to withstand high impact forces and even prevent penetration by a 9mm bullet. With a vault length of 6.5 feet, it can carry a payload of up to 3,500 pounds in a storage capacity of 100 cubic feet. The top-tiered model boasts incredible power and can make 0-60mph in just 2.9 seconds, along with a towing capacity of a whopping 14,000 pounds. As with standard Tesla EVs, the Cybertruck can be charged at home or any of Tesla’s Destination Charging locations or Superchargers, and a single charge will give you more than 500 miles in range. As to its interior, Tesla has taken a minimalist approach, with seating for up to six adults, and a 17-inch touchscreen acting as the center console unit.For those interested, the Tesla Cybertruck is now already taking pre-orders for the price of just $100 USD over on its Design Studio website.
