A German football match ended into chaos on Sunday after a player ran full speed into the opposition manager, sending him flying to the ground.SC Freiburg was beating Eintracht Frankfurt 1-0 in stoppage time when the ball was cleared out of play and Frankfurt's captain, David Abraham, gave chase.Between Abraham and the ball stood Freiburg manager Christian Streich but rather than go around him, the 33-year-old charged straight at Streich, appearing to deliberately bowl him to the ground.You can see Abraham's wild moment:Or if you're in a different region, here:Abraham's challenge unsurprisingly caused uproar on the Freiburg bench, which quickly emptied to confront the defender, chasing him on the field, pushing him, and grabbing at his face.Abraham was shown a red card by referee Felix Brych, as was Freiburg's Vincenzo Grifo, who appeared to target Abraham after the collision."David Abraham is not allowed to do that," Frankfurt sporting director, Fredi Bobic, said after on the club's official website. "He was emotional and provoked, but that must not happen to him. He knows that too. It is a pity that a really handsome game ends this way."There will be consequences for everyone involved."Streich said Abraham apologized to him after the match, and that he wants the incident to be put to bed."Football is a contact sport," said Streich, according to The Guardian."That was on the wrong side of it, though. It was a heated game, we need to calm down, it's done, and not have silly talk about it now."At 54 you can be run over by a young buffalo; you can't hold yourself against it any more."Freiburg's victory, courtesy of Nils Petersen's 77th-minute strike, saw it move to fourth position in the Bundesliga, level on points with FC Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig.Read more:A Mexican footballer accidentally kicked someone in the head and the match had to stop for 11 minutes before the player left for hospital in a neck braceAn Everton FC player's ankle was bent almost 180 degrees and looked so horrific it made the opposition cryAn 18-year-old scored 3 goals for Real Madrid, emphasizing why everybody's calling him the next big thing in Brazilian footballA stalker who sent a pictures of underage girls and a photo of a coffin to an Italian footballer and his family has been jailedCristiano Ronaldo was Juventus' worst player, had a goal stolen by a teammate, and left the pitch subbed off and frustrated in another underwhelming Champions League performance
