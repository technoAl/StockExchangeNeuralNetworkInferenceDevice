LAS VEGAS — Was it pluck or luck that propelled the Canadiens to a 5-4 overtime win over the Vegas Golden Knights Thursday?There was a little bit of both as the Canadiens rallied from a 4-2 deficit in the third period.“It’s character,” said Max Domi, who scored the winning goal after only 26 seconds of overtime. “We had a big win in Arizona last night and then we never gave up in this game and we picked up four points with wins in two buildings that are tough to play in.”Jeff Petry set up the winning goal as he cycled the puck until Domi was able to shake free of former Canadiens captain Max Pacioretty, who has never been known for his defensive skills.“I think the biggest thing is the guys never gave up and we fell behind the eight ball in the third period with a few goals,” said head coach Claude Julien. “We knew it was going to be a tough game (and) the key was not to get frustrated and to stick with it. On the bench, we kept saying let’s get the next one here and put some pressure on. When you believe and you work properly and you do the right things, which we did, we started throwing pucks at the net and we started getting some traffic there and battled around the net. We got rewarded for that.”

To be fair, the bounces did go in favour of the Canadiens.Jonathan Drouin deserves credit for going to the net, but his seventh goal was knocked in by defenceman Brayden McNabb.Tomas Tatar, who relished the idea of playing his former team, sparked the Montreal comeback with a goal that bounced in off his chest as the Golden Knights tried to clear the puck.

And you had to follow the bouncing puck on Brendan Gallagher’s tying goal. Joel Armia’s pass from the corner hit Gallagher’s skate in front, caromed off McNabb’s skate and then went in off Gallagher.The goal came after Julien pulled goaltender Keith Kinkaid for an extra attacker with just over two minutes left in the third period.

“We came in here just to do a job, and ironically enough, I think we had almost the same outcome last year,” said Julien. “We came here and tied it with the sixth attacker and went into overtime, so it is the second time here in the last two games where we have repeated the same scenario.”It was the third consecutive win for the Canadiens, who jumped into third place in the Atlantic Division. They are 4-1-2 on the road.Kinkaid made 31 saves and he has 1-1-1 record with all three of his starts coming in the second game of back-to-back situations that are far from ideal.

 “It’s tough when you have a long layoff between games, but I’m adjusting,” said Kinkaid. “I’ve got three out of six points, but I have to be better, more consistent.’”Tatar, however, gave Kinkaid praise for making big saves after falling behind 4-2.“We were cheating a bit, trying to push the offence and he gave us a chance to come back,” said Tatar.There was a major change in the third line after Jesperi Kotkaniemi was scratched with a minor groin ailment. Rookie Nick Suzuki made his first start as a centre on the third line with Artturi Lehkonen and Paul Byron and didn’t look out of place. He was effective in the faceoff circle, where he won six of his seven draws.phickey@postmedia.comTwitter.com/zababes1Postmedia is pleased to bring you a new commenting experience.
