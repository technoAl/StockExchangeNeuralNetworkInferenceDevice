Conor McGregor has fans all over the world.Perhaps his biggest, however, is Slovakian Mikuas Gerenyi, who has just opened a restaurant themed around the Irish fighter in his home town of Cierna nad Tisou.Named "The Notorious," the eatery features murals of McGregor all over its walls, Irish flags hanging outside, and a fully equipped Proper Twelve whiskey bar. Gerenyi plays his part, too, dressing, grooming himself, and even walking like McGregor.
