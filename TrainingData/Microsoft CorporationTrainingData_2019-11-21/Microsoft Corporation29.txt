"I don't care, rivalry or not, we can't do that. That's kind of the history of what's been going on here lately, hurting yourself, and that's just endangering the other team. That's inexcusable. He knows that. I hope he does now. It's just — it's tough. We'll see."Mayfield was asked what he said on the sidelines as he attempted to calm his teammates down."I don't think there's anything in that moment that I can really say to calm him down," Mayfield said. "The reality is he's going to get suspended — we don't know how long — and that hurts our team. We can't do that. We can't continue to hurt this team. It's inexcusable."On Twitter, many commentators praised Baker for coming out strongly against his teammate, even if it might not go over well in the Browns' locker room.The Browns are on a two-game winning streak as they head into the home stretch of the season. Garrett is likely to face a multigame suspension for his actions.
