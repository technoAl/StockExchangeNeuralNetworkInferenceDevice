So that was fun. Final Score: 6-3 SharksIf you’re anything like me, you probably came into tonight’s game with the hopes and dreams of an undefeated California road trip dancing through your head.

Coming into tonight’s contest, the Sharks had allowed 18 more goals against than the Oilers while also scoring 10 fewer, a combination that had me feeling like this had the makings of a must-win hockey game. That said, the Sharks had also won three straight and are starting to look like they’re going to turn their season around so I knew that a victory was no guarantee, but dammit, I still felt like leaving Cali with four points in tow was entirely doable. I believed. I was ready.The first step in my plan for Californidomination was that the Oilers had to have another quick start, exactly as they had against both New Jersey and Anaheim. Of course, problems with that plan arose quickly when Brent Burns opened the scoring less than five minutes in, Evander Kane followed up with a second goal a few minutes later, and Patrick Marleau added a third before the first period was even close to being over. Good start? Hell, this was a nightmare. Basically, what I’m trying to say is that spotting the other team an early field goal probably isn’t the best gameplan. I’m no scientist but even I can tell you that despite the Sharks not having a great start to the season and their average age is closing in on 50, they’re still a damned good hockey team and that taking a couple of periods off against them is a horrible idea.The bad news is that taking a couple of periods off is exactly what the Oilers did, and it wasn’t until the third period when they finally started to get their legs going. At the end of the day, all you can really do is forget about this one and move on.The wrap.Drew Remenda absolutely thrilled to call a sharks goal again— Ty (@hudec29) November 13, 2019@OilersnationHQ Has anyone thought of sending the moms down to the dressing room at the intermission to give them a firm taking-to? #CouldntHurt #MomFearJust start the beetcast now buddy. Game was over before it started— Harry Calve (@HarryCalve) November 13, 2019Ok. I have a super early call time, and the Oilers have a habit of making a comeback when I give up and go to bed.
