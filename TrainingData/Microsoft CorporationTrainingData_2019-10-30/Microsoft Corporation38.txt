Greetings, Arsians! The Dealmaster is back with another round of discounts and price drops. Today's list is highlighted by a number of deals on Anker chargers, charging cables, and related gear. Amazon is featuring a handful of products from the accessory maker as part of a deal of the day promotion, but many of the discounts we like are actually available outside of that sale.If you're all set on the charging front, we also have deals on Samsung microSD cards and SSDs, Audible subscriptions, various Nintendo Switch games, the new 10.2-inch Apple iPad, and more.Note: Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.
