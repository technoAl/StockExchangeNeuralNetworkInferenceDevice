A $14 discount doesn't seem like much until you consider that Amazon is currently the only major retailer we've seen with any sort of AirPods Pro discount. Amazon is no stranger to unprecedented discounts on Apple devices, so a surprise Black Friday sale on the AirPods 2 or AirPods Pro could be on the horizon.What's the difference between AirPods and AirPods Pro? The steep change in price can be attributed to the addition of noise cancellation and water resistance in the AirPods Pro. If you're wondering if that's worth the extra $100, it definitely is.We'll spread the word if we see any noteworthy changes, but you can keep an eye on current AirPod prices here:Amazon:Apple AirPods with Charging Case (Latest Model) — $139 (list price $159)Apple AirPods Pro — $234.98 (list price $249)Walmart: Apple AirPods with Charging Case (Latest Model) — $139 (list price $159)Apple AirPods Pro — $249 (same as list price)Best Buy: Apple AirPods with Charging Case (Latest Model) — $144.99 (list price $159)Apple AirPods Pro — $249.99 (same as list price)Target:Apple AirPods with Charging Case (Latest Model) — $144.99 (list price $159)Apple AirPods Pro — $249 (same as list price)Staples:Apple AirPods with Charging Case (Latest Model) — $139 (list price $159)
