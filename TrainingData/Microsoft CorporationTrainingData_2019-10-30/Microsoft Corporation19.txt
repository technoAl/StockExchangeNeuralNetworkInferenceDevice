Was the Instant Pot one of the best-selling products on Black Friday last year? Is the Pope Catholic? Is water wet?Surprising absolutely no one, the 8-quart Instant Pot Lux was Walmart's best-selling item in 33 states on Black Friday 2018. The 6-quart Instant Pot Duo was one of the most popular items on Amazon on Cyber Monday 2018. Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2019 will probably be a similar story with the addition of new models that were just released in summer 2019.From what we've seen during our investigations of all the major Black Friday 2019 ad scans (thanks to the intrepid work of our pals at BlackFriday.com), where to find the best Instant Pot deals will depend on the model you want.SEE ALSO: So what makes the Instant Pot so special, anyway? Where to buy the Instant Pot Duo: For now, Walmart. The ad scan shows that the 6-quart 7-in-1 Duo will be $49, which is $30 off the original price and the same price that it was on Prime Day 2019. This matches the lowest price on Amazon history (actually, it's $0.95 cheaper), and though Amazon doesn't release an official ad scan, it's very possible that it will undercut Walmart with an even better price on the Duo.Where to buy the Instant Pot Duo Nova: Target with the steal. The front page of Target's Black Friday ad shows the 6-quart Duo Nova, the new-and-improved version of the best-selling Duo (now with an easier steam release mechanism) for $64.95. This matches its lowest price on Amazon ever, so it's highly likely that Amazon will match this or go lower.Where to buy the Instant Pot Ultra: Probably Amazon. The highly-beloved Instant Pot Ultra was randomly up to 50% off in all three sizes in September, so Amazon would have to slash the price pretty low if they want the Black Friday price to beat that. Your biggest competition is yourself, right?Where to buy the Instant Vortex Air Fryer: Aw, baby's first Black Friday! Instant Pot's first air fryer was released in August 2019 and hasn't been on sale for more than $20 off. Walmart's ad scan shows the 6-quart Instant Vortex on sale for $49, which is a generous $50 off the regular $99. Walmart currently has the 10-quart Instant Vortex Plus for $20 off at $99 and may drop it even more for Black Friday. The only other ad scan that mentions the Vortex is Macy's, where it will be $69.99.We'll spread the word if we see any noteworthy changes, but you can peep the Instant Pot deals that are already live right here:Instant Pot Lux6-quart Instant Pot Lux in red stainless steel from Walmart — $59 (list price $99)6-quart Instant Pot Lux V3 from Amazon — $64.99 (list price $79.95)Instant Pot Duo6-quart Instant Pot Duo from Amazon — $79 (list price $99.95)6-quart Instant Pot Duo from Walmart — $79 (list price $99.95)8-quart Instant Pot Duo from Walmart — $99 (list price $149)3-quart Instant Pot Duo Plus from Amazon — $89.95 (list price $99.95)8-quart Instant Pot Duo Plus from Amazon — $139.95 (list price $159.95)8-quart Instant Pot Duo Nova from Target  — $99.95 (list price $119.99)6-quart Instant Pot Duo Evo Plus from Amazon — $96.49 (list price $119.99)Instant Pot Ultra3-quart Instant Pot Ultra Mini from Amazon — $99.92 (list price $119.95)6-quart Instant Pot Ultra from Amazon with extra $11.33 coupon — $97.49 (list price $149.95)6-quart Instant Pot Ultra from Walmart —$108.82 (list price $149.95)Instant Pot Max6-quart Instant Pot Max from Amazon — $149.99 (list price $199.95)6-quart Instant Pot Max from Target — $149.99 (list price $199.95)Instant Vortex10-quart Instant Vortex Plus from Walmart — $99.95 (list price $119.99)
