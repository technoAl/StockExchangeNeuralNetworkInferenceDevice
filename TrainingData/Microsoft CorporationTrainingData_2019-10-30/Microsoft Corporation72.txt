FWIW, they'll be on sale through the holidays, but maybe not at the deals you were looking for.The best VR headset of the year, and a CNET Editors' Choice, is the Oculus Quest. Bad news: It won't be on sale this holiday. Good news: It's being bundled with $30 in free Star Wars games as part of a Black Friday promotion.Star Wars: Vader Immortal, a $10-an-episode three-part exclusive cinematic experience that's a great ride and excellent demo of what Oculus Quest can do, can be redeemed for free if you buy the Quest from Nov. 21 at 9 a.m. PT through Jan. 31, 2020. The final chapter arrives this week: I've been playing it, and it's great. The more limited-time deals are on the $50 (and $30 off) deals, running from November 28 to December 2.Keep in mind: The Oculus Rift requires a compatible gaming PC to work, and Oculus Go, Facebook's lower-end standalone VR headset, runs different apps from the newer Quest and it's stationary, lacking move-around-the-room full-motion tracking. As for Facebook's Portal devices, keep in mind that Portal is locked to Facebook, and we don't even recommend you consider the Portal TV (though you are, of course, welcome to disagree).Be respectful, keep it civil and stay on topic.
