When Andee Krasinski married her wife, Tina, she knew their day wouldn't be complete without rescue puppies. A lot of them.She was determined to carry shelter dogs instead of bouquets at their wedding in Plant City, Florida, to raise awareness for animals in need of a home — and a local shelter came through just in time."They just so happened to have a dog who had given birth to 10 puppies, which is just the number we needed," she told Insider. "It was very serendipitous."

Krasinski made the decision to include puppies in her wedding party years ago after reading a story on The Dodo about a couple who did the same thing. "I thought, 'If I ever get married, I'm doing this,'" she said.For Krasinski, it wasn't just about getting cute pictures."I used to work in a shelter and I've had the unfortunate job of saying to a dog, 'You have to move on to the next shelter and I hope someone gets you.' And I turn my mind off in case they don't (get adopted). It's so near and dear to my heart," she said.

When it came to finding puppies for their November 11 wedding, she contacted people she knew at shelters, and Nate's Honor Animal Rescue in Bradenton "came in clutch," she said.The shelter pulls in 2,000 animals a year, mostly from kill shelters in the Southeast, she said. She ended up with 10 5-week-old puppies, and each got its own flower crown."I've never seen eyes so naturally blue on puppies," Krasinski said.The pups whimpered a little during the vows, and Krasinski said "one of my bridesmaids did get peed on," but otherwise they were well-behaved.

For now, the puppies have gone back to their mom at a foster home. They will be put up for adoption on November 30, when they are 8 weeks old. Two have already been claimed by guests.That's just the result Krasinski was hoping for."What I was hoping to achieve was to show how many cute animals are waiting in shelters and waiting for someone to save them. You shouldn't be buying puppies when there are so many waiting for homes," she said.








        The couple will be adopting this puppy. They'll name him Swift because Carter is "obsessed" with Taylor Swift.

The couple, who already have two dogs, have also decided to adopt one of the puppies themselves."I know I'm just one person and I know Tina's just one person," Krasinski said, "but I feel like even the small impact we have will make a difference for us and hopefully for them."A shelter celebrated its pregnant pit bull with a maternity photo shoot and the pictures are adorable20 award-winning photos of dogs from 2019's Dog Photographer of the Year competitionSophie Turner and Joe Jonas' dog stole the show at their wedding by wearing a tiny tuxedo complete with bow-tieLike what you see here?
