It will help Iora expand its presence in the US and as it prepares to care for traditional Medicare patients in addition to those in private Medicare Advantage plans, following a new initiative from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, according to one of the sources.Iora is already expanding its footprint across the US.

The company is helmed by CEO Rushika Fernandopulle, who 15 years ago had a radical idea.A primary care doctor by training, he had been treating patients in the standard, insurance-backed way. But he started to realize that wasn't working, and insurance wasn't covering what he wanted to do for patients. "Working in the system, you have to be blind, deaf, and dumb to not realize that the system is broken," Fernandopulle, told Business Insider in an April interview. So he decided to create something new. The practice was initially called Renaissance Health and was based in Arlington, Massachusetts, outside of Boston.There, Fernandopulle gave patients a proposition: He could charge them around $40-$50 a month and wouldn't take insurance. In return Fernandopulle could give them longer doctor's visits, follow-up calls, and more hands-on care to keep them healthier. Since then, Fernandopulle has gone on to found Iora Health, which works with "sponsors" — mainly employers or private health plans for the elderly (known as Medicare Advantage) — that cover a monthly fee for primary care. Iora also built out care teams of nurses and other health professionals that can help the doctors within the practice.Iora says the approach is working. In one group of Medicare patients, Iora says it reduced hospital admissions by 50% and emergency room visits by 20% over 18 months.Doctors care for a group of about 500 to 700 patients, depending on where they practice and the health of those patients.Under the new CMS initiative, which is voluntary for doctors, companies such as Iora could stand to get more business from those in traditional Medicare plans. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said in April that it's expecting to include about 25% of Medicare participants in the new model, or nearly 11 million people.Never miss out on healthcare news.

For instance, health systems including Utah-based Intermountain Healthcare and Pennsylvania-based Geisinger are taking similar approaches with some of their primary-care doctors. The federal government is planning to pay for care for some Medicare patients in a similar way too.This article was published on October 31 and has been updated.
