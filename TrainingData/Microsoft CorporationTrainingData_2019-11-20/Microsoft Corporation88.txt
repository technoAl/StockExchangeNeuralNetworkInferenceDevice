"Without Me" singer Halsey defended Korean boy band BTS on Twitter Wednesday after they didn't receive a single nomination for the 2020 Grammy Awards. "BTS deserved many nominations," she wrote, adding, "I am, however, unsurprised that they weren't acknowledged." "The US is so far behind on the whole movement. The time will come," Halsey said in her tweet.She and BTS notably released a hit single called "Boy With Luv" earlier this year, and even performed together at the Billboard Music awards in May. After sharing that she noticed "a lot of [her] friends and colleagues missing from the nom lists," the singer told upset fans, "please do not waste your anger or frustration... of course I'm sad too. None of it matters. Literally none of it." She also said her single "Without Me" "is still a super tight, record breaking song," despite her lack of nominations for it. But even though Halsey called out Grammys for snubbing BTS, she still had nothing but love for the other nominees — especially Billie Eilish, who broke records for being the youngest person ever to get nominated. "Super happy to see Billie Eilish crushing it. I wish I had someone like her to look up to when I was growing up. She's unstoppable," Halsey shared. "Boy With Luv" topped the charts in the US, Korea, and other countries after its release in April. Despite their hit single together (and in addition to the other new music they released), neither Halsey or BTS garnered a Grammy nomination. Like what you see here?
