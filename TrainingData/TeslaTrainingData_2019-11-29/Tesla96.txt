Despite evidence that lead is an extremely neurotoxic and persistent element (1), its use in hunting ammunition continues. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) is conducting an investigation into ammunition-derived lead's risk to wildlife and humans, but its results will take time (2). Individuals and organizations must take immediate action —independent of governmental legislation—to stop the use of lead in hunting ammunition.ECHA estimates that 35,000 tons of lead is released into Europe's environment each year, including 5000 tons dispersed into wetlands (3). Ammunition-derived lead has caused suffering and population declines in the region's birds (4, 5). Losses due to lead ammunition cost USD1.1 billion per year in terms of lost wildlife and biodiversity, environmental health, and socio-economy as measured by hospitalizations and loss of IQ (6). Yet, EU legislation is rare, and only Denmark and the Netherlands have enacted total bans on lead shot (7).In the United States, documentation of the adverse effects of ammunition-derived lead on wildlife dates back to the 1870s (8). Evidence of millions of water bird deaths annually (9) resulted in a phase-out of lead shot for hunting in 1991 (10). By 2017, a federal ban on all lead ammunition use on federal land was declared; however, the Trump administration revoked the ban shortly afterward (11). Encouragingly, a total ban on all lead hunting ammunition took effect on 1 July 2019 in California (12).We urge national hunter's organizations across Europe, the United States, and worldwide to collaborate and persuade members and industry to phase out the use and production of lead hunting ammunition. This approach would promote the interests of hunters through the survival of more quarry animals and through the stimulation of a more positive public perception of hunting. Moreover, it would protect the environment and prevent further harm to wildlife.This is an article distributed under the terms of the Science Journals Default License.Vol 366, Issue 646822 November 2019 Thank you for your interest in spreading the word about Science.NOTE: We only request your email address so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it, and that it is not junk mail.
