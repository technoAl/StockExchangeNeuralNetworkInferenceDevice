 @akstanwyck Imelda Marcos in “The Kingmaker”Lauren GreenfieldTwo years ago, the Academy documentary branch had to grapple with a record 170 documentary feature submissions for the Best Documentary Feature Oscar. This year, it’s not so bad: only 159 were entered. The short list of 15 will be announced, along with eight others, on December 16.All year, branch members have been getting lists of secure online screeners available to watch on the Academy website, increasing in volume, with more to come. Each voter is assigned a list of about 22-23 films to screen, so they all get covered. But it’s a burden to see them all, so the ones with the most attention move to the top of the much-watch list.Give the advantage to box-office hits that were made available earlier in the year such as Neon’s “The Biggest Little Farm” and “Apollo 11,” as well as high-profile titles from HBO (“Diego Maradona” and “The Apollo”), Netflix (“American Factory,” “The Edge of Democracy,” and “The Great Hack”), Sony Pictures Classics (“Maiden”), Magnolia (“Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am”), and Amazon (“One Child Nation”). Latecomers include festival hits from Feras Fayyad (NatGeo’s “The Cave”), Alex Gibney (Amazon’s “Citizen K”), and Lauren Greenfield (Showtime’s “The Kingmaker”). Documentary features like Neon’s “Honeyland” that have won a qualifying award at a competitive film festival or have been submitted in the International Feature Film category as their country’s official selection are also eligible in the category. Films submitted in the Documentary Feature category may also qualify for Academy Awards in other categories, including Best Picture.Several of the films have not yet had their required Los Angeles and New York qualifying releases. Submitted features must fulfill the theatrical release requirements and comply with all of the category’s other qualifying rules in order to advance in the voting process.“The Cave”NatGeoThe submitted features, listed in alphabetical order, are:“Advocate”
