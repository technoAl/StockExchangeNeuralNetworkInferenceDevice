Can you beat a Tesla Model X off the line with a seven-year old SUV that’s completely stock? Well, if it’s got a Porsche badge on it, then you can at least try…This drag race comes courtesy of The Fast Lane Car YouTube channel, and sees a new $87,000 Tesla Model X dual-motor (not the P100D) line up alongside a 2012 Porsche Cayenne Turbo, which cost a great deal less to purchase.Also watch: Tesla Model 3 Vs Alfa Romeo Giulia QV, Place Your BetsThe owner of this 2012 Cayenne Turbo stated that he paid just $22,000 for it, which is actually a great price for this exact spec and model year.
