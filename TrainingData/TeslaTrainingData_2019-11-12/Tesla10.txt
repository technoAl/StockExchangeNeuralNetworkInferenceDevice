SpaceX's boss entertains a long-time dream of colonizing Mars. His California-based company has so far received authorization from US authorities to launch 12,000 satellites in several different orbits, and it has applied to launch as many as 30,000 more. Starlink is designed to provide high-speed internet connections on Earth. Its mini-satellites will orbit at relatively low altitude (550 kilometers, or 340 miles, for the first ones), allowing quick transmission times. SpaceX says its satellite constellation will be operational for Canada and the northern US by next year. It says 24 more launches will be needed to extend coverage to the entire globe. At present, there are slightly more than 2,100 active satellites in orbit around the Earth. The idea of adding 42,000 has some scientists worried.Astronomers say the proliferation of the bright metallic satellites could seriously degrade the night view, interfering with telescopes trained on space.Others fear that the far more crowded skies will result in expensive collisions between satellites. Share#SEAGames2019: Love at first puckNovember 13, 20194-day work week isinusulong kontra trapikoNovember 13, 2019PSEi falls back below 8,000 as U.S.-China trade concerns resurfaceNovember 13, 2019PAGCOR to stop accepting applications for medical aidNovember 13, 2019Nick Pichay translates Tony Mabesa's swan song 'Fuente Ovejuna'November 13, 2019Bilibid hospital chief: 1 inmate dies every day, jail mortality rate in 'critical condition'November 13, 2019PAGCOR di muna tatanggap ng aplikasyon para sa medical aidNovember 13, 20191 dead, 6 injured in suicide bombing at Indonesian police stationNovember 13, 2019PNP may recommend martial law extension in select areas in MindanaoNovember 13, 2019200 barangay chiefs sa Maynila pinasususpinde dahil sa basura, obstructions sa daanNovember 13, 2019PNP 'obliged' to protect judges with death threatsNovember 13, 2019Dennis Uy's Udenna buys Chevron's Malampaya stakeNovember 13, 2019UAAP: UST's Soriano, Tacatac doubtful for do-or-die vs. FEU in women's hoopsNovember 13, 2019'Why borrow what we won't spend?'
