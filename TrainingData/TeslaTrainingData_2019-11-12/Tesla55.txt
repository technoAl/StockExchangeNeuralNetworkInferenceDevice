Less than a month after Tesla once again surprised traders by reporting a profit for the third quarter, Jefferies has raised its 2020 price target on the carmaker to $400, which would be the highest that Tesla shares have ever traded if its performance continues strong.Business Insider reported Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois had raised his price target on Tesla by $100, and the company’s EBIT estimate for 2020 by as much as 4 percent. He also reaffirmed his “buy” rating on the stock.Tesla’s share price jumped 20 percent following the release of its third-quarter financial report, which not only beat analyst expectations; it beat them by a lot since the Wall Street consensus on Tesla’s Q3 was for another loss.While heavy skepticism about Tesla’ performance is perfectly understandable given its track record, the company has also built a reputation for its capacity to surprise, at the expense of traders betting against it. The latest quarterly profit and the consequent share price jump cost short-sellers more than $1 billion.A team of analysts from Cowen looked into the third-quarter results and maintained their wary stance earlier this month.“The stock has performed well on the headline (third-quarter) profitability results, but we continue to see Tesla as significantly overvalued given the challenging prospects the company is facing with its current product lineup (S/X/3) and our skepticism of the narrative shift to future growth drivers,” they said, referring to the Semi, the Model Y, and Tesla’s solar business, which has been struggling for a while now.The Jefferies analysis, however, is more optimistic. In his note to clients, Houchois noted his expectations for increasingly robust financial performance that will result in higher revenues and a stronger balance sheet in 2020. Despite a warning about the possibility of weaker sales and revenues in the fourth quarter, 2019 is looking good overall and "sets a better foundation for a return to growth in 2020 revenue and earnings," the Jefferies analyst wrote.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Read this article on OilPrice.com
