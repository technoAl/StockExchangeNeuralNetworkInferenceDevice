Samsung's so-called "Galaxy S11" that's expected to be released in early 2020 could come with a camera that has 108-megapixels, according to a reliable gadgets leaker on Twitter, @IceUniverse.For perspective, most smartphone typically have between 12- and 16-megapixel cameras.Samsung had already announced a 108-megapixel smartphone camera module back in August, but it wasn't clear when it would feature in the company's smartphones.  High megapixel count doesn't necessarily mean better photos — Apple and Google use 12-megapixel cameras on their smartphones, and they're the best smartphone cameras you can currently find.
