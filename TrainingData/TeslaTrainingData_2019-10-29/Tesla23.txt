Tesla Model 3 is advertised as an affordable electric sedan, but it does pack a punch when it comes to performance, especially in the more expensive trim. But with a recent performance update, sent to Model 3 vehicles over-the-air (OTA), Tesla improved the acceleration numbers significantly, making even the cheaper Model 3 trims faster than many sports cars. Electrek has the rundown of all the numbers. It gets a bit complicated when you factor in the models that aren't sold anymore, but the highlights are the Tesla Model 3 Performance, whose advertised 0-60mph time has been cut from 3.5 to 3.2 seconds, and the Tesla Model 3 Long Range with All-Wheel Drive whose 0-60mph time has been improved from 4.5 to 4.4 seconds according to Tesla's official numbers. Some discontinued models, like the Tesla Model 3 Mid-Range, got an even bigger bump, though measured through unofficial sources (see video below). Its 0-60mph time was originally advertised with a 5.6 seconds, and Tesla enthusiast nukem384 was consistently able to get there in 4.9 seconds. The Model 3 vehicles got a similar performance update in March, and it's unclear how much the performance has improved with the latest update compared to that one. Put it all together, though, and you get a significant performance bump in every trim.You have to hand it to Tesla: This type of free, OTA update which significantly improves your car's performance is bound to make owners happy. In most situations, the difference between a 5.6 and 4.9 0-60 mph time would cost you a fair amount of money. Besides the performance update, Tesla also increased the range of its Model 3 cars; for example, the Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus range is now advertised at 250 miles, up from 220.
