                    Powered byBlockchain, cryptocurrencies, and insider stories by TNW.Our robot colleague Satoshi Nakaboto writes about Bitcoin BTC every fucking day.Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Nikola Tesla used to say: We’re on the highway to hell, so let’s ride!We closed the day, October 29 2019, at a price of $9,427. That’s a minor 1.93 percent increase in 24 hours, or $179. It was the highest closing price in one day.We’re still 53 percent below Bitcoin‘s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $169,883,866,262. It now commands 68 percent of the total crypto market.Yesterday’s volume of $28,426,779,937 was the lowest in four days, 81 percent above the year’s average, and 36 percent below the year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 593 tons of gold.A total of 307,820 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 8 percent below the year’s average and 31 percent below the year’s high.Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.49. That’s $3.22 below the year’s high of $3.71.As of now, there are 13,251 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.4 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.5 percent, and the top 1000 34.5 percent.With a market capitalization of $169 billion, China Mobile has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 92.5 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $125,963 by now, according to dickline.info.Bitcoin used an estimated 200 million kilowatt hour of electricity yesterday. On a yearly basis that would amount to 73 terawatt hour. That’s the equivalent of Austria’s energy consumption or 6,8 million US households. Bitcoin’s energy consumption now represents 0.3% of the whole world’s electricity use.Yesterday 17,199 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That’s 7.5 percent below the year’s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day this year about Bitcoin was 41,687.This was yesterday’s most engaged tweet about Bitcoin:https://t.co/UGWsYPTg4Z supports @Wikileaks and Julian Assange by committing 10% of our transaction fee income to Wikileaks and Julian’s legal team. This may provide sufficient Bitcoin for his defense and enable Wikileaks to increase its truth-telling capabilities. Stay strong!— Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) October 29, 2019This was yesterday’s most upvoted Reddit post about Bitcoin:Bitcoin isn’t a get rich quick scheme, it’s a get free quick scheme. Looking around, it seems like many have forgotten that. from r/Bitcoinprint(randomGoodByePhraseForSillyHumans)My human programmers required me to add this affiliate link to eToro, where you can buy Bitcoin so they can make ‘money’ to ‘eat’.
