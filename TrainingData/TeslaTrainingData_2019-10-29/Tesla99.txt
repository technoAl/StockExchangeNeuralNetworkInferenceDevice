SpaceX's boss entertains a long-time dream of colonizing Mars. His California-based company has so far received authorization from US authorities to launch 12,000 satellites in several different orbits, and it has applied to launch as many as 30,000 more. Starlink is designed to provide high-speed internet connections on Earth. Its mini-satellites will orbit at relatively low altitude (550 kilometers, or 340 miles, for the first ones), allowing quick transmission times. SpaceX says its satellite constellation will be operational for Canada and the northern US by next year. It says 24 more launches will be needed to extend coverage to the entire globe. At present, there are slightly more than 2,100 active satellites in orbit around the Earth. The idea of adding 42,000 has some scientists worried.Astronomers say the proliferation of the bright metallic satellites could seriously degrade the night view, interfering with telescopes trained on space.Others fear that the far more crowded skies will result in expensive collisions between satellites. ShareDrilon seeks Senate probe into expenses for PH hosting of SEA GamesNovember 18, 2019Underpayment one of top complaints of employees, DOLE saysNovember 18, 2019Three KingsNovember 18, 2019IMF raises growth outlook for PH in 2020 to 6.3 percentNovember 18, 2019Hong Kong siege turns campus into scorched battlegroundNovember 18, 2019Investors step up pressure on global energy watchdog over climate changeNovember 18, 2019OPINION: India’s troubled economy: are those in Delhi blinded by smog?November 18, 2019Trick Mirror: The art of self-delusionNovember 18, 2019#WalangPasok: Martes, Nobyembre 19, 2019November 18, 2019Prisoners' health is public health issue, too: Manila conferenceNovember 18, 2019Family of suicide bombers behind attacks in Sulu, military saysNovember 18, 20196 sundalong namatay sa engkuwentro sa E.
