Tesla's new Cybertruck has not had the easiest start.CEO Elon Musk unveiled the $39,900 Cybertruck on Thursday night. This is Tesla's first truck, which Musk has been hyping up for months.Tesla says Cybertruck is made of a heavy-duty stainless steel and armored glass and can carry six people with a maximum range of 500 miles.The presentation itself hit a snag when Musk tried to show off the truck's armored windows — and his lead designer promptly smashed them.But it seems the Cybertruck has more to worry about than a hiccup in its unveiling. Its angular design is being widely derided on Twitter.Some people said the truck's blocky design reminded them of a badly rendered video game.The video game comparisons didn't end there. Some compared the design to the Warthog, an all-terrain vehicle from the "Halo" franchise.Though this isn't necessarily a bad thing for some customers.One user said its aesthetic came straight from the surreal game "Death Stranding."Others compared the unveiling to the car designed by Homer Simpson in the 1991 "Simpsons" episode "O Brother Where Art Thou."A Google research scientist tweeted that the angular car was reminiscent of the Tomb-Sweeping Festival, a festival celebrated in some East Asian countries in which people buy paper models of material goods and home comforts to burn and send to their ancestors.The truck's exterior wasn't the only part that took a hammering.Whether the Cybertruck's design will be an impediment to its sales remains to be seen.
