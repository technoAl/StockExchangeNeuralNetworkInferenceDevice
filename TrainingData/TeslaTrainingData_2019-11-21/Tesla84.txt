Tesla founder Elon Musk pulled a trick out of Steve Jobs’ playbook today.At the Tesla Cybertruck event tonight, Elon Musk unveiled the futuristic Blade Runner-like pickup truck. It has autopilot included standard, Musk said, a 17” touchscreen, 3,500 pounds of payload capacity, goes from zero to 60 MPH in just 2.9 seconds, and has an adjustable air suspension. In addition, the triple-motor version has “a towing capability of over 14,000 pounds,” Tesla says.Tesla's new CybertruckBut at the end of the show, Musk hesitated, then said he had “one more thing.” That was Apple co-founder Steve Jobs’ signature move: unveil something amazing, then drop one more gem on the audience.That gem turned out to be an all-electric ATV.“We also made an ATV,” Elon Musk said.Tesla's new electric ATV, which fits in CybertruckThe ATV, which Musk gave few details about, looks almost as futuristic as the truck, and not only fits in Cybertruck’s cargo area, it also charges from Cybertruck’s big batteries.In addition, Cybertruck has a built-in ramp that unfolds and extends from the truck’s tailgate, allowing owners to simply ride right up into the cargo area without any other hardware.That’s impressive.Road vehicles have been designed and built with electric propulsion for almost a decade now, but off-road vehicles and recreational vehicles for traditional motorsports have been slow to follow. Tesla ATV fits right in the cargo area of the Tesla CybertruckThere are available models from manufacturers such as Polaris, which makes a 30 horsepower electric utility vehicle, as well as options from relatively new companies such as the New York-based EVS and Oregon’s Barefoot Motors.With massive battery manufacturing capability and probably unmatched EV engineering capability, Tesla  wants a piece of this market – and probably a big piece. And, like it has done with electric cars, Tesla clearly intends to accelerate the adoption of electric motors for vehicles we play in (and on) as well as commute in.One problem: Cybertruck’s “armored glass” shattered in on-stage demo.I forecast and analyze trends affecting the mobile ecosystem.
