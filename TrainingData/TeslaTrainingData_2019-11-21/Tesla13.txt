Tesla's new Cybertruck reveal didn't go quite as smoothly as expected after its "armor glass" windows got smashed during a live test.CEO Elon Musk unveiled the $39,900 truck in Los Angeles on Thursday, and he got Tesla's lead designer, Franz von Holzhausen, to test the left-side windows by throwing a silver metal ball at them.After von Holzhausen smashed the front-left window with ease, Musk exclaimed: "Oh my f---ng God. Well, maybe that was a little too hard.""It didn't go through — that's a plus side," he said.Von Halzhausen then tested the back-left window, which also smashed. "Room for improvement," Musk joked."We threw wrenches, we threw literally the kitchen sink at the glass and it didn't break. For some reason it broke now … I don't know why."

Before the hiccup, in his opening remarks, Musk said trucks had "been the same for a very long time," while images of conventional trucks flashed on a screen behind him.A caption on the screen said "100 years of the same."

The Cybertruck is made of a heavy-duty exterior shell made from "ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless steel" and armored glass, according to Tesla.Musk took pains to show the Cybertruck as being unlike any other production passenger truck on the road, punctuated by a 100-cubic-foot cargo area and up to 14,000 pounds of towing capacity.The premier Cybertruck variant can reach 60 mph in 2.9 seconds, according to Tesla.
