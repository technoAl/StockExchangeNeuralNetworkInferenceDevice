For another $10,000 you can get a dual motor, all-wheel drive, 300-mile range, and 10,000-pound towing capacity.The tri-motor AWD Cybertruck, meanwhile, tops out at nearly $70,000, promising a 500-mile range and 14,000-pound towing*—for all your RV-carrying needs. Oh, and it can travel from zero to 60 mph in 2.9 seconds.Available now to pre-order for $100, production is scheduled to begin in “late 2021,” with the tri-motor option expected sometime after 2022.Cybertruck design influenced partly by The Spy Who Loved Me https://t.co/HKBzxFNfzm— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 21, 2019This week’s launch was about as awkward as any of Elon Musk’s tub-thumpers.But the event went from slightly uncomfortable to positively cringeworthy when the CEO invited lead designer Franz von Holzhausen to demonstrate the strength of Tesla’s “Armor Glass” by throwing a baseball-sized metal ball at the driver-side window.“Oh my f***ing God,” Musk said, laughing. “Well, maybe that was a little too hard.”If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again—on the rear passenger window.“It didn’t go through,” the entrepreneur, always looking on the bright side, said of the second failed attempt. “Room for improvement.”“We threw wrenches, we threw everything,” he said on stage, as reported by TechCrunch. “We even literally threw a kitchen sink at the glass, and it didn’t break. For a little weird reason it broke now, I don’t know why.“We’ll fix it in post,” Musk added, laughing—before moving on with his presentation.* Apparently Tesla’s Cybertruck out-pulled a Ford F-150 in a tug of war.More on Geek.com:
