All Rights ReservedElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla Inc unveiled the company’s new truck called Cybertruck in a grand event in Los Angeles, California with the vehicle expected to put pressure on other carmakers. However, the event didn’t go as planned, after two of the truck’s armoured glass windows cracked during a demonstration of their strength.During the unveiling of Tesla’s new offering, Musk bragged about the vehicle’s strength and first asked a volunteer to smash the vehicle’s door with a sledgehammer. Then came a demonstration to highlight the strength of the armoured glass used in the windows.The first throw caused the window to break into a spiderweb and an expletive was audibly heard at the Tesla Design Center. As Musk’s assistant laughed nervously, the billionaire said: “Well, maybe that was a little too hard.”Then came a second attempt, in which the ball bearing was thrown at the rear window. It didn’t go any better, and that window was also badly damaged. “It didn’t go through,” said Musk, in an attempt to lighten the mood.However, he then had to continue with rest of the presentation with the damaged vehicle behind him, with the image going viral.Smash hit?Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveils the all-electric battery-powered Tesla Cybertruck in California – but the demonstration of the armored-glass didn’t go entirely to plan pic.twitter.com/B8JCoKmQKC— AFP news agency (@AFP) November 22, 2019But that wasn’t the only talking point. To go on sale with a starting price of $39,900, the truck’s sharp geometric shape inspired many memes online. Musk had earlier tweeted the design was partly influenced by the Lotus Esprit sportscar that doubled as a submarine in the 1970s 007 film “The Spy Who Loved Me”.#Cybertruck was the biggest trend on Twitter globally, with plenty of opinions mocking the design of the car.
