Actor Jonah Hauer-King was recently cast as Prince Eric in Disney's upcoming live-action adaptation of "The Little Mermaid," and people wasted no time in thirsting after him on social media. This is the first major role for Hauer-King, who was born and raised in London, and previously appeared in films like "The Last Photograph" and "A Dog's Way Home." He also played Laurie Laurence on the 2017 BBC miniseries "Little Women," and will appear in the upcoming films "The Song of Names" and "Once Upon a Time in Staten Island." Now, Hauer-King will join actress and singer Halle Bailey (who will play Ariel), in the upcoming remake of "The Little Mermaid." Even though Hauer-King is a relative newcomer to Hollywood, users on Twitter expressed their excitement over his casting, as well as their appreciation for his good looks. Others pointed out that Hauer-King has more than a passing resemblance to the animated version of Prince Eric from the 1989 original film. Some people, however, still felt that former One Direction singer Harry Styles (who'd previously been in early talks for the role, but ended up passing) would've been a better choice for Prince Eric. But overall, everyone seemed pretty excited for Hauer-King to take on the role — especially given how cute he is. Like what you see here?
