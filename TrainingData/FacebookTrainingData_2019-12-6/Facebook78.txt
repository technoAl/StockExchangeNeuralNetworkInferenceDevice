"The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina" star Kiernan Shipka reunited with her former TV dad, Jon Hamm, at her birthday party on Sunday — and shared an adorable photo of the two of them to Instagram. "Dad showed up!" Shipka captioned the photo, which showed Hamm smirking at the camera while the actress made a duck face and flashed a peace sign next to him.Hamm famously played Don Draper, the father to Shipka's character Sally Draper, on AMC's hit show "Mad Men," and won several awards for his portrayal of the struggling ad executive.

Plenty of other stars also appeared to be in attendance at Shipka's 20th birthday party, including YouTuber David Dobrik, "The Office" actor BJ Novak, and Ross Lynch, who stars with Shipka on "The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina." And while Shipka's former costar January Jones (who played Don's wife and Sally's mother Betty on "Mad Men") didn't make it to the event, she still wished her TV daughter happy birthday on Instagram. "You have become such a success in life and in this silly world we call work. I couldn't have asked for a better onscreen daughter/partner in crime," Jones wrote in her post, adding, "Known you since you were 6! Happy 20th! Love, Mom." A post shared by  January Jones (@januaryjones) on Nov 9, 2019 at 9:00pm PSTNov 9, 2019 at 9:00pm PST
Fans were loving both Shipka's and Jones' posts, with some even urging for a "Mad Men" reboot or revival. "Sally Draper spin-off! I want it!" one fan wrote, while another simply said, "Nothing warms the heart like a family reunited." Like what you see here? Subscribe to our daily newsletter to get more of it.
