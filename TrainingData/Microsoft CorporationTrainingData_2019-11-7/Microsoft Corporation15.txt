Wait! There's still time! Sure, you procrastinated. You didn't plan any Halloween costume. You weren't going to dress up at all but now all your friends are, and you don't want to be left out. Lucky for you there are still plenty of options available for a last minute Halloween costume that isn't just "ghost" or "mummy." That does mean, though, that some of these may require a little creativity  and possibly some minimal arts and crafts. But all the ingredients are there for you to whip up a perfectly acceptable Halloween costume before time runs out.

Holding up your phone for everyone to see on live TV isn't the best move. As a last minute costume idea, however...Dig into your closet or your dad's and pull out any suit (really any shirt, jacket, and tie combo will do). Get some glasses, grit your teeth until you feel like they're going to just quit and fall out, and just go around showing everyone your phone screen. Maybe throw in a "shut up, moron" for good measure.

A post shared by Us (@usmovie) on May 15, 2019 at 12:30pm PDTWant something easy but no less scary? The disturbingly creepy, homicidal doppelgängers — the "tethered," as they're called — from Jordan Peele's hit horror movie Us are almost too perfect. You'll just need to wear as much red as you own and carry a pair of scissors. Just, please. Don't run with them. Bonus points for only speaking in a chillingly dry voice. It's a difficult shot to take, but it takes the costume to a whole new level. Probably a good idea to pack some cough drops, though.

A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Aug 16, 2019 at 11:34am PDTOld Taylor is back! Gone are the dark outfits, serpentine imagery, and trap beats that characterized Swift's previous album, Reputation. We're back to warm tones, pastel overtones, and guitars with Lover. To be Taylor Swift this year, you'll probably need a blonde wig, for starters. Add a heart-shaped outline of face glitter around one eye, don your favorite white tee, and dye the tips of your hair (or wig) blue. Don't forget the trademark red lips.Thought we'd throw in a unique combo for those looking for a big swing this year. We imagine tethered Taylor Swift probably goes with little-to-no makeup, wears all red, maybe slicks her hair back, and carries those big scary scissors from Us. To poke a little fun, have the scissors cutting up a piece of paper with the words "Spelling is fun!" on it — a light jab at the singer for cutting out the now —infamous bit from the album version of her song "ME!" It's time for a takeover of the Tethered Taylors!
She buries hatches, but she keeps maps of where she puts them.

A post shared by Laura Wilfon |Blogger |Cookier (@wineatbedtime) on Oct 14, 2019 at 10:57am PDTThe teeth-whitening kit Instagram ads will rule us all! Why are these things all over the place? They're so inescapable, in fact, that you probably wouldn't be surprised to see one parading around the neighborhood as a Halloween costume this year.If this is what you want to be for Halloween, be sure to like this post and click the link in bio — er, sorry, got carried away there. Just tie together a nice, trendy outfit, carry around a box labelled "teeth-whitening kit," and hold up your phone up to take some pics like you're trying to earn a living. I’m dead. This show. This priest. No one warned me. #Fleabag #hotpriest pic.twitter.com/1j4agL3AYv— RaeAnn (@thebaby209) October 6, 2019Hot Priest became one of the year's hottest TV characters, thanks to the acclaimed series Fleabag, created by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The costume is simple enough: all black with a black-and-white shirt collar for extra priestyness. But you have to wear it with confidence in order to nail the sexy aspect of the look. Unbutton the collar and make sure to develop a good smolder. It can't hurt. Hot Priest is absolutely the answer to your Halloween prayers.

A post shared by Ina Garten (@inagarten) on Oct 2, 2019 at 10:13am PDTWho doesn't love Ina? The famous Food Network personality deserves a seat at the Halloween table this season. Pair a comfy scarf with any button down, roll up those sleeves like you're getting ready to roll out some bomb ass raisin scones, and fasten the cutest brunette bob to the top of your head. Complete the look by sliding on a bracelet or a watch for that extra drip.

A post shared by Men In Black (@meninblack) on Oct 11, 2019 at 5:03pm PDTWe don't have to talk about their latest outing, but the Men In Black franchise still makes for an easy-breezy costume piece-y. Wear a black suit and sunglasses. That's seriously it. If you're looking for a Neuralyzer to wipe some memories, you could use a variety of objects. A pen. A screwdriver. A laser pointer. A Beats Pill speaker. If it's long and cylindrical (alright, go there at your own peril), it can also be a Neuralyzer.

Handsome Bachelorette contestant/Bachelorette-winner-until-becoming-a-Bachelorette-loser/country singer-songwriter/dog-food-commercial vocalist Jed? There are many Bachelorette-themed costumes you could go with, but we figured Jed would be the most memorable. Grab a flannel out of the closet (be sure to leave it unbuttoned). Throw on a pair of jeans. Gel the hair back and grow out the scruff (or Magic Marker some on). Boom. You're basically Jed. Although if you have it, please please please sport an acoustic guitar. Maybe write a love song. Or don't! We're sure no one will mind if you refrain.

A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Mar 6, 2019 at 7:49pm PSTGet your high ponies in gear, y'all! Ariana Grande, pop princess of a generation and vocalist extraordinaire, is here to save your Halloween-procrastinating ass. You'll need a sweater oversized to all hell, leggings, and high-heel boots. Tie that hair up in a high pony, wing that eyeliner, and let your voice soar to octaves you didn't know you were capable of reaching. Or just, like, do your best or whatever. Or don't sing! As long as you have the look, a Halloween costume is one less problem you'll have to think about.

A post shared by Hustlers (@hustlersmovie) on Sep 12, 2019 at 6:10pm PDTA Hustlers-themed costume really lets you get your glam on. Hustlers (starring Constance Wu, Jennifer Lopez, Keke Palmer, and Lili Reinhart), a riveting crime thriller about strippers who learn to scam the hell out of their Wall Street clientele post-economic crash, is a great fit for a group costume. Shine in the sleekest dress you own, add some jewelry for style, and pop the champagne like you just swindled 10 finance bros out of their credit cards.

A post shared by The Babadook (@the.babadook) on Jul 29, 2016 at 7:48pm PDTIf you haven't seen Jennifer Kent's The Babadook by now, hoo boy are you in for a deliciously frightful surprise. Besides being one of our 15 best films of the decade, The Babadook also stars a fearsome antagonist who just happens to make a wonderful last minute costume: The Babadook, itself! You'll need pretty much head-to-toe black. A ski mask will work for minimum effort to highlight the right facial features. Get some black gloves on your hands, a top hat on your head (because the Dook is classy), and smile big and bright. If you want add a little pride to your costume to honor the creature's status as a gay icon, throw in a little rainbow color anywhere you see fit. And baba-damn! You got yourself a killer last minute costume.

A post shared by John Wick: Ch 3 - Parabellum (@johnwickmovie) on Aug 31, 2019 at 5:06pm PDTSuits are looking surprisingly versatile for late-in-the-game Halloween looks this year. Another way to make a suit work for spooky season is by being John Wick, fictional former hitman and deadly rogue of the neon-lit criminal underground. In Chapter 3, Wick (played by Keanu Reeves) finds himself in a desperate spot and goes to an old friend, Sofia (Halle Berry), for help. Although, based on how they left things, he might not receive it. Flanked by two shepherd dogs, the two dominate a wildly pinpoint, edge-of-your-seat fight scene that absolutely rips. For Sofia, black leather everything is the key, with some gold accents and jewelry if it's available. The best part about this duo costume, though, is that you get to take the doggos with you. Just keep them away from the candy.to all of you who played Club Penguin, i give you this pic.twitter.com/AU9QtRH51h— Jaynautic (@jaynautic) May 2, 2019Club Penguin mid-2000s really was the peak of human civilization. With a little bit of effort, you can make it work as one of these little guys for your costume. Ideally, you have a sweater or jacket (or short-sleeved tee if you live in a warm area) in the color you want. Then, take some white construction paper and tape it to the front of your shirt/sweater to make the penguin's belly. You might need to use some scissors to shape it right, depending on how much you care. An orange or yellow party hat strapped around your face will work for a beak, and if you have similarly colored shoes or boots, those are your flippers. We'll admit this one might be a bit of a tough sell, but if you try busting any of the moves above, people might get it!

We saved the most spine-chilling, viscerally horrifying costume for last: The Justice League "Snyder Cut." Referencing a director's cut (that may or may not exist) of the movie Justice League – a critics' headache and box office disappointment. Some devoted DC fans insist on the existence of this alleged Snyder Cut, proof of which would surely send the rest of us into an existential panic. The point: It's scary. And it also happens to be a solidly niche costume idea for your superhero-themed Halloween party. Or a gathering of your fellow cinephiles. Happy Halloween from #JusticeLeague. pic.twitter.com/J0JEWEycg7— Justice League Movie (@justiceleaguewb) October 31, 2017Anyway, on to the costume. It's easy. You'll need any old black shirt. Go back and grab your white construction paper (landscape orientation) and draw horizontal lines across it, writing "Justice League: The Snyder Cut." Slap it on the front with some tape, and you're instantly transformed into a floppy disk of the dreaded Snyder Cut. Fair warning: Don't be surprised if a film critic shows up and tries to bury you. They're only trying to do the right thing.
