The US Constitution states that a sitting president can be impeached for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.What constitutes "high crimes and misdemeanors" is very broad, and can include non-criminal acts. The definition of impeachable acts is designed to be broad and vague because impeachment is a political act. Constitutional scholars say there are virtually no limits on what Congress can include in articles of impeachment.If the House votes to impeach President Donald Trump, he would be the third president in US history to be impeached. Both previously impeached presidents were acquitted by the Senate. In former President Bill Clinton's case, the House charged him with four articles of impeachment: obstruction of justice, abuse of power, lying under oath to a grand jury, and lying under oath in a civil court case. In former President Andrew Johnson case, the House voted on 11 articles of impeachment, mostly over his alleged violation of the Tenure of Office Act when he removed the secretary of war. The key alleged crimes for which experts say Trump could be impeached: If the House Intelligence Committee passes articles of impeachment, they go to the full floor of the House and require a simple majority vote of 218 members to pass. Members vote on each article individually, meaning Trump could be impeached on some articles but not others.For Trump to be removed from office, two-thirds of the US Senate — 67 members — must vote to convict him of articles of impeachment. Sonam Sheth and Grace Panetta contributed to this report.
