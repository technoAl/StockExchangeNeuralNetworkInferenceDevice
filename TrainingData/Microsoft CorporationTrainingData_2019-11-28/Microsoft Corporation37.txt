An FA Cup second round match on November 30 will be the biggest match in Chichester City's history.The English eighth division team was given a first-round bye in the tournament after its opponent was expelled, and now must face either Wycombe Wanderers or Tranmere Rovers — both of whom lie five divisions above — at the end of the month.Unfortunately for manager Miles Rutherford however, he may have to travel without his star striker, Scott Jones, who comically said he'd rather be out surfing."When the swell's good, you gotta go," Jones told the BBC before an array of laughter in the background.When asked whether he'd rather score the winning goal in the second round or be out catching waves, he said: "It's tough, probably surfing though."To add to Rutherford's dilemma, it emerged that even if Jones isn't at the beach, he'll likely miss the tie anyway because his girlfriend is American, and he will "probably" have to travel stateside for Thanksgiving, which is on November 28."Sometimes I play!" Jones, who is club's top scorer this season with three goals, concluded.Club chairman Ashley Clack finished the interview segment by saying, "I wish he was joking, but he's deadly serious."Premier League clubs enter the FA Cup in the third round, meaning should Chichester beat Wycombe or Tranmere, it could come up against one of England's biggest teams at the next stage.Whether Jones will be out surfing for that remains unclear.Read more:A referee accidentally scored a goal during a Dutch soccer game, then caused outrage by refusing to disallow itThe 'child' who went viral after being filmed smoking at a charity soccer game is reportedly actually 36An Australian sports journalist was accidentally charged $100,000 for a bottle of beer during a work trip to England, and he won't get his money back for over a week
