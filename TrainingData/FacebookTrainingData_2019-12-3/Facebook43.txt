We haven't even reached Black Friday yet, but that isn't stopping Amazon from talking about Cyber Monday. The company has just announced its plans for what it's calling the "biggest Cyber Monday Deals Weekend ever", with thousands of deep discounts kicking off on November 30 and lasting through the weekend. This year, Amazon says you'll find cheaper prices and more options available than last year, and new deals will keep dropping throughout the whole weekend.Some of these deals are prices we expect to see for Black Friday as well, and others are new offers that we haven't seen yet. Either way, it looks like the next seven or so days are shaping up to be packed full of discounts galore, so stay tuned here for all the best ones as they become available.Buy one Galaxy S10 or Note 10 and get one free at VerizonAmazon DevicesAmazon BrandsFashionElectronicsToysHousehold, Kitchen & Home FurnishingsSmart Home & Home ImprovementPatio, Lawn & GardenAudible, Music, Video & BooksPetsSports & OutdoorsBeauty & GroomingHealth and Personal CareAutomotiveBabyAmazon Payments & Gift CardsAmazon BusinessSmall and Medium-sized Businesses on Amazon Handmade and Amazon LaunchpadGrocery and Gourmet
