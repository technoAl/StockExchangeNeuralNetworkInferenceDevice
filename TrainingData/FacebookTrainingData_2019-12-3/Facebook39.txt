The company has just announced its plans for what it's calling the "biggest Cyber Monday Deals Weekend ever", with thousands of deep discounts kicking off on November 30 and lasting through the weekend. This year, Amazon says you'll find cheaper prices and more options available than last year, and new deals will keep dropping throughout the whole weekend.Some of these deals are prices we expect to see for Black Friday as well, and others are new offers that we haven't seen yet. Either way, it looks like the next seven or so days are shaping up to be packed full of discounts galore, so stay tuned here for all the best ones as they become available.These 8 Cyber Monday deals are still available right nowAmazon DevicesAmazon BrandsFashionElectronicsToysHousehold, Kitchen & Home FurnishingsSmart Home & Home ImprovementPatio, Lawn & GardenAudible, Music, Video & BooksPetsSports & OutdoorsBeauty & GroomingHealth and Personal CareAutomotiveBabyAmazon Payments & Gift CardsAmazon BusinessSmall and Medium-sized Businesses on Amazon Handmade and Amazon LaunchpadGrocery and GourmetOn December 3, 2019, Larry Page and Sergey Brin announced that they were stepping back from Alphabet and appointing Sundar Pichai as the company's new CEO.Google's pushed a new update to its photo gallery app that lets you chat with friends about the photos you've shared.Pixel phones are supposed to be the first to get software updates, but for two months in a row, the Pixel 4 has been hit with delayed security patches.Kano has some of the best coding kits for kids and right now they are up to 50% for Cyber MondaySign up now to be notified of the latest news, rumors, & more
