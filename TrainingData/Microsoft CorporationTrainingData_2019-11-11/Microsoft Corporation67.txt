So you're a Marvel fan thinking about getting a Disney+ subscription. Or you're a Disney+ subscriber thinking about getting deeper into Marvel. Either way, you're probably wondering what, exactly, the new streaming service has for you. We're here to break it down.The TL;DR is that Disney+'s Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup won't exactly be comprehensive on day of launch. Only a handful of MCU movies and almost none of the MCU shows will be available right away, and none of the new scripted MCU shows will be here yet. But there's lots of intriguing stuff coming down the line if you're willing to be patient — and in the meantime, there'll be lots of non-MCU Marvel content to enjoy, including tons of older and current animated series. (I, for one, cannot wait to dig back into the classic X-Men TV series from the '90s.)Want to know more? Here's a comprehensive guide to all the Marvel content coming to Disney+.Marvel's Hero Project, a docuseries about young real-life heroes, is the only new Marvel series that will be available on Disney+ on day of launch. Marvel’s 616: 2020. This is a docuseries that promises to "dive into the rich historical, cultural and societal context" of Marvel — starting with the Gillian Jacobs-directed first episode, "Higher, Further, Faster," about the women of Marvel Comics making their way in a male-dominated industry. Paul Scheer is also set to direct an episode. And so it begins!Welcome back guys... #TheFalconandtheWinterSoldier #PlayBoys #Legdaysaveslives #setlife #Marvel pic.twitter.com/xBvaZirXci— Anthony Mackie (@AnthonyMackie) November 4, 2019The Falcon and the Winter Soldier: Fall 2020. Filming has already begun on this series, which is set after Avengers: Endgame. It will bring back Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan in the title roles, plus Emily Van Camp as Sharon Carter, and Daniel Brühl as Helmut Zemo. Also on board is Wyatt Russell, who'll play John Walker.WandaVision: Spring 2021. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are back for this trippy live-action series, described by Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige as "half classic sitcom, half MCU spectacular." They will be joined by Kat Dennings as Darcy Lewis, Randall Park as Jimmy Woo, Teyonah Parris as a grown-up version of Captain Marvel's Monica Rambeau, and Kathryn Hahn as a nosy neighbor.

 Here’s the new Loki logo... and here’s how excited I am to get started.A post shared by  Tom Hiddleston (@twhiddleston) on Jul 21, 2019 at 2:29pm PDTLoki: Spring 2021. Tom Hiddleston returns as the notorious trickster in a series that will detail what happened to Loki after he stole the Tesseract during the time heist in Avengers: Endgame. Marvel’s What If...?: Summer 2021. This animated series imagines what might have happened if key plot points within the MCU had turned out just a little bit differently — like, for instance, if it had been Peggy Carter and not Steve Rogers who got the super-soldier serum. A whole lot of the MCU live-action cast will voice their animated counterparts, and Jeffrey Wright will narrate as the Watcher.Hawkeye: Fall 2021. Jeremy Renner will return as Clint Barton, and Hailee Steinfeld has reportedly been offered the role of his protégé Kate Bishop — who, as comics readers know, eventually becomes the new Hawkeye.Ms. Marvel, Moon Knight, and She-Hulk: TBD. All three were announced at D23 in August 2019, but we don't know anything yet about when they'll arrive, or which cast and crew will be involved.You don't need to do anything, but if you're an MCU completionist, you'll probably want to. The new MCU shows are expected to tie closely into the MCU movies, with some characters even jumping back and forth between both mediums. For instance, whatever Scarlet Witch goes through in Disney+'s WandaVision will inform her next big-screen appearance in Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness. Iron Man (2008) pic.twitter.com/i51FvCtETb— Disney+ (@disneyplus) October 14, 2019Iron Man, Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man, and Captain Marvel will be the only Marvel Cinematic Universe films streaming on Disney+ right away. Avengers: Endgame will join that list not too long after, on Dec. 11. In non-MCU news, Big Hero 6 and the made-for-TV animated film Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors will also be available day of launch.The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War, Doctor Strange, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will not stream on Disney+ right away. They'll probably come to the service at some point in the not-too-distant future, but as of now we don't know exactly when.
Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, and Ant-Man and the Wasp will also likely head over to Disney+ at some point, after the current Disney-Netflix licensing deal runs out. Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, Spider-Man: Homecoming, and Spider-Man: Far From Home won't be available on day one, either — and since these titles weren't originally distributed by Disney, it may be more complicated for the company to get the rights to stream them. Inhumans will be the only Marvel Cinematic Universe series available on Disney+ at time of launch. Non-MCU series available right away on Disney+ will include (all animated): Spider-Woman (1979-1980)Spider-Man (1981-1982)Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends (1981-1983)X-Men (1992-1997)X-Men - Series (1992) pic.twitter.com/rs32n7amSy— Disney+ (@disneyplus) October 14, 2019Fantastic Four (1994-1996)Iron Man (1994-1996)The Incredible Hulk (1996-1997)Silver Surfer (1998)Spider-Man Unlimited (1999-2001)Avengers: United They Stand (1999-2000)X-Men: Evolution (2000-2003)Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes (2006-2007)Wolverine and the X-Men (2009)Iron Man: Armored Adventures (2009-2012)Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes (2010-2013)The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes (2010) pic.twitter.com/3DXAMs9wmS— Disney+ (@disneyplus) October 14, 2019Ultimate Spider-Man (2012-2017)Avengers Assemble (2013-2019)Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.
