Has anyone had a busier 2019 than Adam Driver? Not only does our dude have Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker coming next month, he's starring in two movies out at this very moment: Marriage Story, and The Report.The latter stars Driver as Daniel J. Jones, the real-life Senate staffer tasked with investigating the CIA's use of "enhanced interrogation techniques" — torture — after 9/11. Annette Bening plays his boss, Senator Dianne Feinstein.In the exclusive clip above, the two of them discuss his recent findings, including the reveal that the CIA waterboarded one target 183 times without obtaining any useful information. As Feinstein says, "If it works, why do they need to do it 183 times?"Driver puts in one of the finest performances of his career, and he's complemented nicely by Bening's clear-eyed concern.
