Some days, social media is a gift. This is one of those days.Jason Momoa, star of Aquaman and also our hearts, got up close and personal with a real, live bear at some point in the not-too-distant past. I guess this is tied to his new Apple TV+ series, but all I see is an adorable bear gently extracting a cookie from the mouth of a gentle giant.Please enjoy.

 The things we do for our ART. SEE. Is out. Please watch on Apple TV+. The bear needs to know your scent. So here’s my cookie kisses big guy.  Love you tag.  Aloha Baba VossA post shared by  Jason Momoa (@prideofgypsies) on Nov 1, 2019 at 11:49am PDTMomoa's new series, See, is set in a distant future where humans long ago lost their sense of sight and figured out how to get by without it. That natural order is then thrown into disarray when it turns out a village chieftan's (Momoa) newborn twins can see.In our review, Mashable's own Tricia Crimmins called See "a respite from our own world" and encourages Apple TV+ subscribers to at least check it out. As Tricia writes:Based on the two episodes (out of ten) I’ve seen thus far, See certainly succeeds in creating a plausible, futuristic vision in which its characters and plot can exist. Both in concept and meticulous execution, the series is creative, different, and fresh. For that reason alone, it’s worth checking out the first episode. I'm guessing there's a notable bear that pops up in one of the opening episodes, if Momoa's out here doing this bear thing "for our ART."
