A pizza in the shape of a jack-o'-lantern sounds exciting in theory, but in reality it looks creepy AF.Papa John's, the pizza chain that came under fire in 2018 after its founder and former CEO John Schnatter reportedly used a racial slur during a conference call, recently tried to hype customers up for Halloween with a festive seasonal special: A pizza shaped like a jack-o'-lantern with pepperonis.The promotional photo of the $11.00 pizza looked sort of cute and also sort of creepy, but it also looked well put together with a good-sized stem, symmetrical olive pupils, and nice, clean pepperoni crust, eyes, and mouth.The Jack-Oâ€™-Lantern pizza is back. Itâ€™s a lot like a normal Jack-Oâ€™-Lantern, except youâ€™re the one with lights in your eyes. ðŸŽƒðŸ¤©Grab one for just 11 bucks. pic.twitter.com/bfaoFybINnâ€” Papa John's Pizza (@PapaJohns) October 27, 2019SEE ALSO: Mitt Romney's grandson dresses as Pierre Delecto for HalloweenWhen people ordered the pizza, however, it did not look as advertised.Several disappointed and confused customers who ordered from Papa John's expecting a beautiful jack-o'-lantern pie to arrive at their houses tweeted photos of their not-so-stunning pizzas at the restaurant chain.Here are a few of the jack-o'-lantern pies gone wrong â€” though we will say they're spooky, which is technically still on-brand for Halloween.Thought this was a neat idea, but i guess its the thought that counts pic.twitter.com/XTF2stGYwkâ€” Elizabeth M Hinrichs (@ElizabethMHinr1) October 27, 2019ðŸ¤” Kids were pretty disappointed by whatever this is supposed to be... pic.twitter.com/FsQ3gDq4Q6â€” Jessica (@thefirstjess) October 27, 2019No one at my house knew it was a jack o lantern lol.
