LOS ANGELES — On Sunday, Ford Chairman Bill Ford and CEO Jim Hackett — with some help from Idris Elba, who worked at a Ford plant in England before he made it big — revealed the much-anticipated Mustang Mach-E.The all-electric SUV was controversial when announced. Mustang purists might not have wanted the pony car's iconic styling and nameplate applied to an electric vehicle, much less a crossover SUV.But Ford took the plunge and staged a Tesla-level extravaganza to introduce the newest Mustang to the world.Check out the Mustang Mach-E:"The Mustang Mach-E wholeheartedly rejects the notion that electric vehicles are only good at reducing gas consumption," Hau Thai-Tang, Ford's chief product development and purchasing officer, said in a statement."People want a car that's thrilling to drive, that looks gorgeous and that can easily adapt to their lifestyle — and the Mustang Mach-E delivers all of this in unmatched style."The latter should yield 300 miles on a charge."The batteries are secured inside a waterproof battery case surrounded by crash-absorption protection," Ford said. "They are liquid-cooled to optimize performance in extreme weather and to improve charging times."Ford said that at a "peak charging rate of 150 kW, the Mustang Mach-E with an extended battery and rear-wheel drive can add an estimated average of 47 miles of range in approximately 10 minutes while charging on a DC fast charging station.""The standard-range Mustang Mach-E is estimated to charge from 10 percent to 80 percent in approximately 38 minutes while charging on a DC fast charging station," the company added.Owners who use a Ford Connected Charging station could "add an estimated average range of 32 miles per charging hour on a 240-volt outlet, based on extended-range, rear-wheel-drive configuration," Ford said. A mobile charger could add 22 miles per hour on 240-volt power.Ford said it would work with Amazon Home to facilitate the installation of charging stations.Like Tesla with the Model 3, Ford is doing away with the need to carry around car keys."Getting in and starting the vehicle is easy and effortless with Phone As A Key technology, which makes its debut in the Ford brand lineup in Mustang Mach-E," Ford said."Using Bluetooth, the vehicle can detect customers' smartphones as they approach, unlocking the Mach-E and allowing them to start driving without getting their phones out of their pockets or using a key fob."The next-generation Sync infotainment system's interface "ditches complicated menus, making it easier to access features with touch, swipe and pinch controls that every smartphone owner will be comfortable using," Ford said."Mach-E holds another surprise under its hood — a drainable front trunk storage unit," Ford said."Providing 4.8-cubic-feet of storage space, the front trunk is large enough to comfortably store the equivalent of a carry-on luggage bag. And because it's drainable, customers can easily pack it full of ice and keep their favorite beverages cold."Get the latest Ford stock price here.
