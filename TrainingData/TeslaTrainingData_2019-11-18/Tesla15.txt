This is the 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E all-electric SUV.A new horse has just galloped into Ford's stable, one that's unlike any other Mustang the company has ever built. As you've undoubtedly heard, the 2021 Mach-E is an all-electric SUV that promises to bring pony-car panache to a normally sleepy vehicle segment. Ford has just unveiled the Mustang Mach-E tonight at a special event just ahead of the 2019 LA Auto Show, and if you missed it the first time, fear not -- you'll be able to watch the re-stream here momentarily. Just click the box directly below this paragraph to watch the event as it unfolded.Adding more excitement to the event, actor Idris Elba hosted the Mach-E's grand unveiling. If you like what he and the rest of Ford's team had to show, you'll can already reserve one of these SUVs today. To ensure you're one of the first to park a Mach-E in your stable, all you have to do is plunk down a fully refundable $500 deposit.Even with features like 300+ miles of range, 0-60 mph in around 3.5 seconds, over-the-air updates and a huge new infotainment system, it remains to be seen whether Ford has put the cart before the horse. Is the world prepared for a Mustang SUV, one that's all-electric, no less? Some die-hard enthusiasts of this pony car are sure to buck with fury, unable to rein in their emotions over such controversial new product. But perhaps they shouldn't hope that it gets shipped off to the glue factory, because this vehicle is sure to bring lots of style and galloping performance to market. Competing against much sleepier mainstream EVs like the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Bolt, along with more enthusiast-minded offerings like the Tesla Model 3, Ford's new Mach-E will almost certainly be a dark horse entrant in the broader EV segment. Of course, it remains to be seen how well this vehicle will sell, since you can lead drivers to a horse, but you can't make them buy.Apologies, that's more than enough equine references for one news story.
