The Tesla Model 3, which was being driven in Gisborne, was in Autopilot Mode during the incident - a feature that enables the car to steer, accelerate and brake on its own A family of ducks in New Zealand had a lucky escape last week, after a Tesla car swerved out of its way at the last minute.  The Tesla Model 3, which was being driven in Gisborne, was in Autopilot Mode during the incident - a feature that enables the car to steer, accelerate and brake on its own. During the incident, a family of ducks started crossing the road, just as the car came down the road.The driver, who remains unnamed, has admitted that he didn’t notice the ducks because of a shadow on the road.However, using one of its eight cameras, the car itself detected the ducks, and quickly swerved out of the way to avoid them.The driver said: “If it wasn't for the Autopilot function, I think the ducks would not have survived.”While Autopilot may have saved the ducks this time, the feature has been blamed for other collisions in the past. For example, Tesla hit the headlines back in March after one of its cars was involved in a fatal collision in Florida. The incident saw a Tesla Model 3 crash into a semi-truck, sadly killing the driver in the process.A follow-up report by the National Transportation Safety Board revealed that the Tesla had Autopilot mode activated seconds before the crash.Jeremy Banner was behind the wheel of the Tesla on a four-lane highway in Palm Beach County, when the semi-truck pulled out in front of him.Despite having Autopilot mode activated, the Tesla slid under the truck’s trailer, cutting off the top of the car, and killing Mr Banner.
