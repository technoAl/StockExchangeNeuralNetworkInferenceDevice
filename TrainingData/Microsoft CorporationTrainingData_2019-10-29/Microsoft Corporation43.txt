While Sunday's episode of "The Walking Dead" revolved heavily around Negan's escape from Alexandria, it also made one huge, unexpected reveal. Ezekiel tells Siddiq he has thyroid cancer, showing him a huge mass on his neck. "A month. It's grown since then," Ezekiel says of how long the mass has been growing.

Siddiq initially tries to tell him it's not necessarily cancer. "Without tests you can't be sure," says Siddiq. But Ezekiel tells him there's been a history of the cancer in his family with his grandmother and his father successfully surviving due to treatment. The King isn't feeling as positive in the zombie apocalypse about his chances. The news caught a lot of fans off guard. Many are disappointed by the news since Ezekiel survived his comic death. Fans are saying it would have been better for the show to have killed him last season if they're going to be forced to watch him die a slow death now. On season nine, the Whisperers killed 10 characters they kidnapped. In the comics, Ezekiel notoriously winds up on the final pike revealed in an emotional moment. Instead, his son Henry took his place on the show.

The reveal didn't come out of nowhere. It finally explains all of Ezekiel's mysterious coughing since the season 10 premiere. It wasn't the smoke inhalation that was getting to him.Still, some fans are hoping that Ezekiel maybe doesn't have cancer or that he'll find a cure if he is sick.We'll have to wait to learn more about what exactly is going on with Ezekiel.
