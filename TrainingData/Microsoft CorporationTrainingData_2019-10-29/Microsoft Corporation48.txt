Tommy John makes some of our favorite men's underwear and women's underwear; in our buying guide to the latter, senior editor Malarie Gokey says its pairs are "hands down the most comfortable underwear you can buy."  The brand also makes loungewear and sleepwear, socks, undershirts, women's bras, and even blazers.From Sunday, November 24 through Cyber Monday, December 2, you can get 25% off orders of $100 or more. Starting on Saturday, November 30 and running through December 1, you can also receive an additional 10% off men's and women's loungewear.From Cyber Monday, December 2 through December 4,  you can save 25% sitewide with no order minimum and get free shipping.These are by far the steepest discounts we've seen the brand offer; last year's Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers were for 20% off. The sale is a great opportunity to restock your underwear drawer with high-quality undergarments for less. Without any discounts, men's underwear styles cost $18 to $45 per pair and women's underwear styles cost $20 to $36 per pair. If you're looking for holiday gifts, Tommy John also has you covered with gift ideas for him, gift ideas for her, and gifts under $100.
