(And if we're being honest, it's about damn time.)Now, we know what you're thinking: You've seen a couple of Samsung gadgets featured in other retailers' Black Friday ads. Who cares if the brand itself is offering discounts on its products if everyone else is, too?We hear you: figuring out a game plan for Black Friday is stressful as it is, and you probably already have too many stores on your "to-visit" list. But hey, that's why we're here.Keep reading to find out which Samsung.com deals you should actually care about (and where you can shop instead to score better bargains on certain devices):

We haven't seen any good pre-Black Friday deals on the Galaxy Buds so far this year — which is kind of a shame, because we really like them. However, you can get a pair of them for free by upgrading your existing smartphone to a new Samsung Galaxy Note 10 or Galaxy S10 (starting from $309.99 or $339.99 with eligible trade-in, respectively) anytime between Nov. 21 to Dec. 1.If you don't want to trade in your existing phone, you've got a chance of scoring a good deal on a new Samsung phone starting Nov. 21 — that's when select unlocked Galaxy Note10 and Galaxy S10 devices will be on sale for up to $300 off at Amazon, Best Buy, and Samsung.com.

The Galaxy Watch Active2 is the latest addition to Samsung's line of smartwatches, and aside from a random Amazon promotion earlier this month, it's never been on sale before. It comes in two different sizes — 40mm (normally $279.99+) and 44mm (normally $299.99+) — and both of them will be $50 off on Samsung.com from Nov. 22 to Dec. 2. The following wearables are also included in Samsung's Black Friday sale:Save $80 on the silver Samsung Galaxy Watch (46mm, Bluetooth) from Nov. 22 to Dec. 2.

Deemed "the iPad Pro's only serious competitor" by former Mashable tech reporter Raymond Wong, the 10.5-inch Galaxy Tab S6 is a fast, powerful, and lightweight tablet that comes with its own S Pen. Amazon will give you a free $50 gift card if you buy it off its site right now, but we recommend getting it somewhere else: Samsung is offering a $100 discount on the tablet's $649.99 MSRP from Nov. 21 to Dec. 29, and the folks over at Best Buy will give you a free $100 gift card if you buy it from them.Other holiday tablet deals on Samsung.com include:Save $200 on the 10.5-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 (64GB, WiFi) through Nov. 29. (FWIW, Amazon has it for the same price.)Save up to $80 on the 10.1-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab A (32GB, WiFi) on Nov. 21 and 22. (Note: Amazon will give you a free $50 gift card if you order this tablet from its site, but Samsung's deal is still better.)Save $50 on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A Kids Edition (32GB, WiFi) from Nov. 21 to Dec. 2.

Wong also mused that Samsung's sleek and responsive Notebook 9 Pro "could be the Windows 10 laptop to beat this year" when he checked it out at CES 2019 — so, you know, no big deal. It typically retails for $1,099.99, but you can save $200 by ordering it through Samsung.com anytime between now and Nov. 30. (FYI: It's the same price at Best Buy, but we don't know how long that deal will last.)You can also score deals on the following laptops during Samsung's Black Friday sale:Save $250 on the Samsung Notebook 7 Spin through Nov. 30.Save $200 on the 15-inch Samsung Notebook 9 Pen through Nov. 24.
