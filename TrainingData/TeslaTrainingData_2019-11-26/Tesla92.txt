Even without advertising Tesla Cybertruck has already received more than 200,000 pre-orders. This is a boastful tweet by Elon Musk after that embarrassing debut. Cybertruck offers a better utility vehicle that a truck yet more performance that a sports car, the exterior shell is made for ultimate durability and passenger protection. Look at that body, it starts with impenetrable exoskeleton, each component has been designed for superior strength and endurance, from Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless-steel structural skin to Tesla armor glass. Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla’s chief designer, even hit the door with a sledgehammer and it didn’t dent. However, the window glasses were shattered (unintentionally) when he threw a metal ball, yeah, it was an embarrassing moment, but it seems now it has become a free advertisement for Cybertruck.The smooth monochrome exoskeleton of Cybertruck offers you and passengers maximum protection. The armor glass is claimed to be made of ultra-strong glass and polymer-layered composite, which can absorb and redirect impact force for damage tolerance. Well, it seems like Tesla has to do some improvements on this claim. Elon Musk also explained why those windows glasses shattered, it was because when the door was hit with a sledgehammer, it cracked the base of windows’ glass.Anyway, Tesla Cybertruck features vault-like storage where you can keep your toolbox, tire, and many more. It offers you 100 cubic feet of exterior, lockable storage. Thanks to powerful drivetrain and low center of gravity, this futuristic electric pickup truck delivers extraordinary traction control and torque, it accelerates from 0 to 60mph in as little as 2.9 seconds with up to 500 miles or range.
