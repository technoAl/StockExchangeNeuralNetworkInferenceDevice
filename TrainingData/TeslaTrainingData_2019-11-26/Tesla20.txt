All Rights ReservedDespite the cracked windows at its first demonstration, there’s no shortage of enthusiasm for Tesla Motors’ latest offering — the electric pickup truck called Cybertruck. It has already received over 1.5 lakh bookings, and now the company’s chief Elon Musk tweeted a video of the pickup truck winning a tug-of-war against an offering by its closest competitor, Ford Motors.In the video tweeted by Musk, the Cybertruck is seen pulling a Ford F-150 pickup truck, which is Ford’s bestselling vehicle in the category. The Ford truck and Cybertruck start at the same time, but the Tesla Motors’ truck seems to easily pull its fuel-powered competitor uphill.The video received over 12 million views since it was tweeted.Cybertruck pulls F-150 uphill pic.twitter.com/OfaqUkrDI3— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 24, 2019However, a Bloomberg report pointed out that the Ford vehicle in the video seemed to be a two-wheel drive version of the F-150, while the Cybertruck is a four-wheel drive, which would mean it had better grip and more power. The curb weight and tyre type of the Ford vehicle were also conveniently not mentioned, which hinted that it might not have been a fair tug of war, the report pointed out further.That seemed to be the point that a Ford executive was making when he tweeted at Musk challenging him to a fresh test.Sundeep Madra, vice-president of Ford’s unit for developing new business models, tweeted at Musk asking him to send over the Cybertruck for an “apples to apples” test.— sunny madra (@sundeep) November 25, 2019Musk simply responded: “Bring it on”Bring it on https://t.co/pCnln1NdRO— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 25, 2019Looking little like traditional pickup trucks, the Cybertruck, which will start at $39,900, has a stainless steel exterior with a triangular roof. Tesla Motors is hoping that it will compete against Ford’s bestselling trucks in the future.The company unveiled three models: a single-motor rear-wheel-drive for $39,900, a dual-motor all-wheel-drive for $49,900, and a tri-motor all-wheel-drive for $69,900. The most expensive truck tows 14,000 pounds and can go up to 500 miles on a single charge, Tesla said. Production of the pickup truck will start only in late 2021. We might see a fair amount of Ford vs Tesla till then.Download the Indian Express apps for iPhone, iPad or Android© 2019 The Indian Express Ltd. All Rights Reserved
