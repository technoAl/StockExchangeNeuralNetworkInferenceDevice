								@FredericLambertWhile all eyes were on Tesla in Los Angeles for the Cybertruck unveiling, another Tesla event went unnoticed in Seoul as Tesla started deliveries in Korea.The automaker held a special event resulting in stunning pictures.

As we previously reported, Tesla originally had some issues entering the Korean market.Tesla buyers didn’t have access to the very generous electric vehicle incentive of up to 26 million won (~$21,000 USD) offered by the government.The reason for the ineligibility was pretty ridiculous for anyone familiar with long-range electric vehicles. For an EV to be eligible for the incentive, the electric car needed to be able to fully charge in under 10 hours using a standard outlet.It unfairly gives an advantage to vehicles with small battery packs and shorter ranges. Vehicles with larger packs and longer ranges, like Tesla’s, can charge in under 10 hours, but by using level 2 chargers or fast-charging, not a standard outlet. Other EV incentive schemes, like California’s ZEV mandate, include charging speed restrictions, but they are nowhere near as restrictive as this Korean scheme.Realizing the error back in July 2017, the government fixed the rule and Tesla has been doing a little better in the market, but Model S and Model X remain expensive.With the Model 3, the incentives will make a much bigger difference.In August, Tesla launched the Model 3 in South Korea for as low as ~$26,000 USD with incentives.Last Thursday, as Tesla was holding its Cybertruck event in Los Angeles, the automaker was also holding a delivery event in Seoul.Rocky Lau told Electrek that Tesla delivered 113 cars during the event and he shared the picture featured above.Local members of the owners club reportedly voolunteered to help Tesla deliver the record number of cars in the country.As we previously reported, the Model 3 launched in Korea starting at 52 million won (~$43,000 USD), but with the central government’s subsidy worth 9 million won and even bigger provincial subsidies, the Model 3 could start at less than 32 million won (~$26,000 USD) with incentives.South Korea is a relatively big automotive market with over 1 million passenger cars sold per year, but it is dominated by domestic brands like Hyundai and Kia.Local subsidies have greatly accelerated EV sales in the country last year and with the launch of new models, like Tesla’s Model 3, EV adoption is expected to be even greater in South Korea this year.FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

The Tesla Model 3 is the first vehicle built on Tesla's third-generation platform. It aims to reduce the entry price for electric vehicles while not making any compromise on range and performance.

The Model 3 starts at $35,000 in the US and deliveries to employees and company insiders began in mid 2017 - customer deliveries begin in late 2017.
