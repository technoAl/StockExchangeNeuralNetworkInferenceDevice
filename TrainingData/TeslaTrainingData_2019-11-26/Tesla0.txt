I spent a decent chunk of the weekend putting a dent into my Disney+ queue—thanks, 4K Dolby Atmos Star Wars movies—but my enjoyment of Disney’s cheap streaming service is slightly dampened by the various films that are still bound to Netflix. However, you can start getting your queue ready for titles like Black Panther right now, and Disney+ will even give you a hard date for when they’re schedule to arrive.The key to all of this is knowing that movies like Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Thor: Ragnarok aren’t technically available for streaming on Disney+ just yet, but they do have landing pages on the platform. Search for them via whatever app it is you use to access the service, and you’ll see them:Not only will you get the exact date for when your favorite films will arrive on Disney+, but you’ll even be able to add them to your Watchlist in advance. (While I don’t think that means you’ll get a notification when they’ll available, at least they’ll be easier to organize and find.)In case you’re lazy, like me, and you don’t want to do a lot of searching, here are direct links to some movies you might care about over the next year or so, as well as their release dates:Star Wars: The Last Jedi - Dec. 26, 2019Solo: A Star Wars Story - July 9, 2020Coco - Nov. 29, 2019Incredibles 2 - July 30, 2020Ralph Breaks the Internet - Dec. 11, 2020Beauty and the Beast - Oct. 1, 2020The Jungle Book - May 30, 2021 Thor: Ragnarok - Dec. 5, 2019Black Panther - March 4, 2020Avengers: Infinity War - June 25, 2020Ant-Man and The Wasp - July 29, 2020Christopher Robin - Sept. 5, 2020 Maleficent - Oct. 1, 2020 Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales - Dec. 2, 2020 Mary Poppins Returns - Jan. 9, 2021 Tomorrowland - Sept. 1, 2021Senior Technology Editor of Lifehacker. www.murphy.wtf
