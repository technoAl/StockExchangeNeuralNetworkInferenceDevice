                by Johnna CriderNovember 25th, 2019 by Johnna Crider It seems like everyone wants a Tesla Cybertruck. Whoever said there was no demand for this truck is completely clueless. I have seen several tweets from people saying they are getting one or have pre-ordered one. I even plan to reserve one once some personal issues are out of the way (divorce). However, seeing many people I interact with daily — such as Viv, Michell, Vincent, and Sofiaan — share their screenshots and excitement about purchasing the Cybertruck almost made me give in and order it now.demand is a problem! I have to wait to long to get mine pic.twitter.com/o731bEQqfj— CyberTruck's TintDepot (@tintdepot) November 23, 2019As of yesterday, according to Elon Musk, there have been 200,000 orders of the Tesla Cybertruck. These numbers are going to grow as more and more people talk about it and watch the videos.200k— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 25, 2019Perhaps unveiling a new truck, bringing it on stage, and beating it up was a very smart thing to do. I do think it was hilarious they broke the windows. Actually, the windows didn’t break, they just cracked really badly. In my experience, dropping something as hard as a quartz crystal can shatter glass. Seeing steel balls being thrown at the glass and it not shattering was really unreal. It would be something cool to see in the next Fast and Furious movie, for sure. I bet they would have fun wrecking the Cybertruck.The demand for Tesla’s new Cybertruck is not only high, but I think it may have broken the internet. People are still talking about it, and even Safelite Autoglass is using it to promote their product. It’s actually pretty funny and just shows why Tesla doesn’t need to advertise. Simply drive up, break some glass, and the internet does it for you.Pullin' up to Safelite like (3/7) pic.twitter.com/oHRt6iFjAq— Safelite AutoGlass® (@safelite) November 22, 2019The funny thing is the claims that no one wants a Cybertruck. There is absolutely no demand, just like Little Tesla doesn’t want to attack my toes or anything else that moves. (Little Tesla is a kitten, by the way, and kittens love toes and anything else that moves). Since there is zero demand for Tesla’s hot new Cybertruck, I am going to show you several nonexistent tweets by people who want and pre-ordered a Tesla Cybertruck.  There were also some funny tweets in there. Of course, this is a tiny subset of the 200,000 pre-orders.The more I think about the new @Tesla truck the more I feel it is a quantum leap in design. Not car design. Design. It redefines boundaries far wider than currently accepted. It's that same quantum leap I am looking for in art or music. It will spawn new ideas in other fields. pic.twitter.com/bibL8bmCyV— Patrice Bäumel (@patricebaumel) November 22, 2019So, I ordered 3 #Tesla #Cybertruck's pic.twitter.com/wTh0RPhHcL— Sofiaan Fraval (@Sofiaan) November 22, 2019I ORDERED A CYBERTRUCK(The website’s down right now, so I can’t post that obligatory screenshot, but I got a reservation number!!!) https://t.co/J5kxvmQGL0I'm voting with my wallet. I love it! #teslatruck pic.twitter.com/BM8vrm9Cs7— Tesla Canuck (@TeslaCanuck) November 22, 2019— T-Pain (@TPAIN) November 22, 2019Every Youtuber I follow has put $ down for a @Tesla CyberTruck.  I have no need for another car, no need at all for a truck, no where to park it and it will def cause a fight w the wife but imma probly have to get one too— Casey Neistat (@Casey) November 23, 2019Resistance is futile Casey, join us! pic.twitter.com/qrp9Aa3BK2— Tesla Owners Online (@Model3Owners) November 23, 2019Joke all you want, but this @Tesla truck would be sick in a zombie apocalypse pic.twitter.com/rxun2CS4EM— The Walking Dead (@TheWalkingDead) November 23, 2019I ordered the Tesla truck and welcome our cybertruck AI overlords. @elonmuskMom I wear I size large in Tesla truck for Christmas.— Matt (80%) (@thereal_MattC) November 23, 2019The Tesla truck is the only real life application of the Pythagorean triangles that 12 year old me thought would be useless— Divyansh Saksena (@divsksna) November 23, 2019Cant wait to hear the first rapper say "Yo girl built like a Tesla Truck" Inna song— Yayo Maradona (@Nesquivelli) November 23, 2019Of course you are.You're LL Cool J.— CleanTechnica (@cleantechnica) November 25, 2019One thing for sure is that everyone is talking about Tesla’s Cybertruck, and since the holiday season is pretty much here, I can already guess as to what people will be talking about at the Thanksgiving table and what people are getting for Christmas in a couple of years. Who needs to pay for advertising when you can break the internet? With that in mind, the demand for Tesla is definitely there. I can’t wait to see a bunch of Cybertrucks on the roads in the next few years.Cybertruck is inspired by games like Halo.
