Elon Musk took to Twitter to show the strength of the new Cybertruck in a video showing the pickup towing the Ford F-150. The legacy carmaker says the test was a gimmick, without disclosing the model of the F-150 being towed. Ford exec Sunny Madra replied to Musk's tweet, asking the Tesla CEO to send a Cybertruck for an "apples to apples" test. In other Musk news, he says he will testify in his own defense against a defamation lawsuit brought by a British cave explorer.
