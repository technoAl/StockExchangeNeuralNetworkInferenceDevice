Last week’s Tesla Cybertruck introduction is still dominating discourse, and in classic Tesla fashion, it’s doing so in a truly annoying way. Following a sketchy tug-of-war with a downslope-pointed, rear-drive F-150 intended to show the cockroach-shaped Cybertruck’s brawn, Ford has demanded a do-over on a (literal) level playing field.Again, it’s annoying.While “polarized” doesn’t begin to describe the reaction to Cybertruck, one comment about the retro-futuristic EV caught my eye. It was a reason why someone might not consider the vehicle, and it has nothing to do with power, price, or build quality.The auto writer in question, despite loving the avant-garde wedge design, voiced concerns on social media about the vehicle being potentially unsafe for pedestrians (valid), too large (also valid, but perhaps less so in this segment), and “maybe deeply anti-social.”Scrolling through the dictionary, one discovers that anti-social means “contrary to the laws and customs of society” and/or “antagonistic to sociable instincts or practices.”Can we no longer go our own way? Must we now worry about offending the sensibilities of a bunch of randos we’ve never met? Listen, while Tesla still needs to answer a long list of unanswered questions before I’d give Cybertruck a go, its overall appearance, like that of any vehicle, needs to appeal to just one person: myself.A buddy of mine drives a Scion xB and an Isuzu VehiCROSS because he likes oddball cars. His desire to be offbeat comes with a side effect of being noticed, and that’s alright with him. Where would we be as a society if we couldn’t express ourselves through the vehicles we buy?Visually jarring? Bring it on.What’s your take on this, B&B? When thinking of purchasing a vehicle, have you ever taken into consideration society’s reaction to your potential purchase? Did it matter one iota?[Image: Tesla]Oh boy. This one should be fun.Eh?  That’s what happened recently in auto news.  Would you rather TTAC ignored auto news that isn’t about gas engines?—not really.  All the other introductions happened a couple months ago.  Los Angeles didn’t appear to offer up a lot except for EVs.
 Everything else is just special editions.“no engine technology updates”Please, no. :-)I’m very intrigued by this “truck”!I see sort of a land-based F-119 stealth aircraft, although I don’t know how long the styling will be viewed as fresh, since the F-119 was grounded years ago, and the relevance is questionable.Who knows? Is this thing comfortable? How well can you see out of it? Is the interior roomy?I say build a ton of them and sell them like hotcakes! I’d like to see one up close because I find it very appealing.F-117, I believe.  But that’s an interesting angle (!) — combined with lack of a big metal engine, what would this thing do for radar speed enforcement?Yes, my mistake – F-117. Thanks for correcting that.As for police radar evasion, I wonder… although I didn’t think of that!Hmmm… I’d like to see that tested.Yes, especially when I was young I wouldn’t drive an old man’s car (Buick) or a “girl’s” car (VW b*tch basket). I did end up buying a ’69 Buick Riviera when I was 18, because it was such a fine car. I told myself it was a young old man’s car.These days I buy what’s right for me and my needs and couldn’t care less what others thoughtI don’t put louder exhaust systems on my cars/motorcycles because I know they bother people.Right around my 40th birthday last year something switched and I no longer considered loud exhaust to be awesome.
There was no significant event that caused it that I can put my finger on. At some point I would hear someone drive by in a loud car and think, “Congratulations, you spent $800 on a noisemaker.”I can’t point out when exactly I no longer required a subwoofer in my car, and I no longer enjoyed driving around with my windows open blasting my British indie rock for all to hear. Though overall, I find way fewer people doing it than when I was younger. So maybe it’s not just me.You’re not alone. I’ll turn 40 in January, and I’ve hated loud exhausts for a least 3 years or more. 18 year old me loved all that noise, especially the loud drone of the 2-chamber flowmasters under my ’68 Camaro at the time. Wouldn’t live with that today if you paid me. Granted, I still enjoy  listening to a good *sounding* exhaust note, I think my 335i sounds pretty nice. But volume-wise, forget it. Same goes with music. Dammit, I’m getting old! lolI’m probably the youngest one in this chain but I dont like loud exhausts myself. They dont help me commute, they dont help gas mileage, its just noise. Where I live most loud exhaust systems are the product of rust, saws, and straight piping.In a way its backwards, across my state people have always whined about the noise from airports, race tracks, and amusement parks as subdivisions corrode the landscape. Now that we have plenty of homes we celebrate our peace and quiet with loud dogs, loud exhaust, loud dogs, loud children, loud dogs, and loud audio systems.Did it matter one iota? Yes.  We have a 2018 Cadillac Escalade Platinum but I don’t drive it to work.  I take the train to most days and when I do drive to work, I take the GTI.  I just don’t want the headache. “Hey Jim, you don’t need a raise.  You’re driving a Cadillac-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack.”There is a book called “Drive a modest car” that goes into this line of thinking, especially if you are the company owner.Rule #1, you never want to drive a car better then your boss’s, so unless he drives a Bentayga it’s probably wise to leave the Escalade home“Absolutely. Depending on your profession, it matters.”
Around 1993 I had an interview for an accounting position.  My car was a red Celica All-trac.  I thought that would project the wrong image, so I borrowed my wife’s grey Camry.  I got the position.Later, I found out the 2 people that interviewed me, both, thought I drove up in the red Porsche 911 that had been parked across from me.  So it goes.Can we be done with this truck? The discussion about it is worn out. I’m tired of reading the same analysis but with a different writer, words and context. The truck was not interesting to begin with and now the media buzz is more like the obnoxious background hum of a backup generator in Bagdad.Is he such a weak delicate flower that he sees an inanimate object as anti-social?Hard times create strong men,
Strong men create good times,
Good times create weak men,
Weak men create hard times.and hard men create babies…It’s simple.  Buy what you like.  Your purchase has to satisfy you, nobody else.  Of course there are things that you can do with your purchase that makes you a POS.  Like rolling coal.  Or driving 45 in the left lane.  But these things are far more of a reflection on you, not your choice in vehicles.Agreed but some vehicles are going to attract attention and certain comments from people who assume stereotypes. As long as you are OK with this and can handle it then you’ll be fine. Drive a Prius? You are an eco-weenie. Drive Hummer? You eat baby seals for breakfast. Sometimes these stereotypes are spot on, but often they are not. Clearly this Cybertruck thing is polarizing – its an EV which puts you in one camp yet at the same time the styling and size puts you in the opposite camp. Talk about an odd and difficult marketing position.They sold the Impala SS, the good one 25 years ago, with “Lord Vader, your car is ready.”  Today it would be one of the most cheerfully styled cars in the school drop off line.  Even the Subarus that the pussy hatted drive to Whole Foods are all creases and angry headlights now.  Hatred and fear of your fellow man is the in thing these days.  Cars are just one of a thousand expressions of that.This will end well.There HAVE to be B&B here who at one time in their lives would have refused to buy a Miata for it either being a girl’s car or a car driven by men who prefer the company of other men. I’m mostly looking at you, guys who lived in the late 90s.New Beetle too, at the same time and for the same reasons.“There HAVE to be B&B here who at one time in their lives would have refused to buy a Miata …”At one time?My big cybertruck questions are is weight and safety. Being made out of 3mm stainless steel, combined with the battery it’s probably looking at being 6000lbs. You can see in the f150 tug o war video it’s also noticeably longer and wider, like f350 in size. If you’re in a crash in this thing what if rescuers can’t break the unbreakable windows or cut through the exoskeleton with the jaws of life? I’m sorry but you want vehicles to be destructible for a reason. Then the added weight just reduces efficency, why not make a unibody design like the honda ridgeline but bigger? It just makes me think the cybertruck is more of a concept that’s put out there to grab more deposits and more capital from investors and there’s no better way to do that with a crazy design that’s not to be taken seriously, hence the cheap $100 deposit instead of the big deposits that they required for the 3 and y.Bingo, we have a winner.I’m becoming triggered over the unreal number of articles about electric Mustangs and Tesla trucks. Enough already.On another note, after seeing the picture above, it shouldn’t squat that badly in the back when there is a relatively light “sport” ATV in the bed.  I hope it’s showing off some hydraulics used to lower the back on purpose.@BunkerMan: That’s exactly what they’re showing. It has hydraulics to lower itself. Also the ability to lower itself for highway travel.The only way I can interpret that is talking about those who would drive one of these because of its intimidating look.  Pretty much the same as those hicks who drive lifted diesel pickups; they’re immature man-children who think “I can’t legally p!ss in your face to assert my dominance, so I will do this instead.” You know, pretty much every 20-something d-bag.It is antisocial to take a subsidy to flaunt the whiffle life that lets you buy expensive toys. If there is social unrest, being a giant target for all the angry people having their rights eroded for the greater evil probably won’t turn out to have been a survival tactic. The fear is in Musk’s head, which is why he is selling the fantasy that these stainless-steel middle-fingers are bullet-proof.Speaking of social unrest, is this vehicle antisocial enough to be torched by anarchists at Donny’s next inauguration? It’s a rolling sign of wealth and income inequality, taking up far more resources than any one person is entitled to. But it’s also electric, and thus saving the world. How to resolve this paradox? I remember them torching a limousine on K St. on 1/20/17. What happens if a Tesla was sitting in its place?I used to work with an eco-terrorist who is now a member of the deep state with a high security clearance. His group was burning Ford Excursions at Richmond dealerships. One time we could see a Ram SRT-10 at a dealer ‘tent sale’ in Charlottesville, and he just about lost control of his faculties. His face turned bright red and his mouth foamed as he snarled that it needed to burn. He isn’t going to be burning a Tesla truck, and the people he hates have a history of creating civilization, thus being civilized. I don’t know what will happen, but anything could.I bought a brand-new, Dodge Ram 2500 in December 1993.  I spent 6-months being educated on what Dodge was doing and became convinced that their new truck and campaign was more than just schtick and fact that the “The Rules Have Changed”.  I liked the new Dodge’s looks and didn’t care if nobody else did.  A couple years later Dodge had convinced several hundred thousand other people like myself.  In that case, I rolled the dice and won.Tesla rolled the dice and lost.  It tells me that Elon has a bunch of “Yes” men surrounding him.  Tesla has a long road ahead of them to convince potential buyers to buy the ugliest vehicle they ever saw.  Tesla will need to bring some serious content to overcome the looks.  Doug DeMuro and I both thought the Cybertruck was a PR ruse and figured that the “real” truck would soon appear.  Sadly, this was not the case.“Tesla rolled the dice and lost.”Well, they do have over 200,000 (albeit cheap at $100) reservations for the Cybertruck.  An electric F-150 would only receive a fraction of that.I know.  We’ll see…I didn’t choose my vehicles to make any social statement, I bought them for my own personal needs and/or enjoyment.  But then, I realized that a lot of people do read their own social values into my purchases.  I don’t care much but it’s interesting.  I can see how some people wouldn’t enjoy being pre-judged when you roll up.A friend of mine told me that people buy cars for the lifestyle they wish they had. Probably true for many, certainly not all. “A friend of mine told me that people buy cars for the lifestyle they wish they had.”Given the number of vehicles sold with the Track, Sport or Off Road package this seems accurate. Its not about what you need, its about what you want. Almost nobody needs bullet proof windows, but now that they can order some they can check that box then brag about it.Steph, you sound like you slept right through SOC 100 in college.I’ve had 3 Pintos, a Fiat, 4 minivans, a hybrid, 2 EVs, and a host of other cars.All served a particular purpose when I got them, but making a social statement was never one of them.  In fact, one of the many reasons I balked on the Model 3 last year was the badge statement.  Maybe next time.I have never thought one iota about the way society perceives me, the way I dress or what I drive.I’m not sure if that makes me totally cool or just clueless…This Cybertruck needs to be lifted so it’s unsafe to other drivers in a collision, have external speakers installed so everyone can hear it for a mile, and have a two stroke engine running in the bed so everyone following has to breathe its raw hydrocarbons.Only then will it be anti-social enough to compete with the brodozers, Harleys, and catless Subarus.Regarding the Tesla Cybertruck (funny how quickly the “naming” controversy died down – lol), I’m just going to post this here for future reference.5 Stages of Grief (KÃ¼bler-Ross model):
