Following a rather embarrassing demonstration that saw the window’s of Elon Musk’s new Cybertruck smashed with a metal ball, the Tesla CEO is now taking a shot at Ford. In a new attempt to prove how hard the Cybertruck goes, Musk has challenged the Ford F-150 in a tug-of-war against his new futuristic model.First shown during the unveiling event in Los Angeles last week, the video sees the Cybertruck easily defeating the F-150. According to some, however, the test wasn’t a fair one.Cybertruck pulls F-150 uphill pic.twitter.com/OfaqUkrDI3— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 24, 2019Over at TechCrunch, experts claim that Musk’s test was rather questionable. First off, the F-150 appears to be in two-wheel drive mode and using old tires, meaning that the rear wheels had far less rear-weight than the Cybertruck, which is a “dramatically heavier” (around 1,000 pounds) vehicle.The report then goes on to pinpoint additional contributing factors that state this fight is not a fair one, identifying a difference in engine class — the Ford F-150 is missing the 3.5L engine badge, meaning whatever engine it does have, it’s not top-of-the-line. It also notes a difference in traction; as Tesla’s vehicle pulled first, it increases its own traction and decreases Ford’s as a side-effect.A badass @Tesla looking like it’s doing a badass thing.  But if the @Ford F-150 is RWD **with no payload** then weight on the Rear Axle is greatly reduced, offering only mild traction for the Tesla to overcome. This contest is more about the Physics of Friction than Engine Power.— Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) November 25, 2019Following the video, Ford X’s VP Sundeep Mandra has responded to Elon Musk, asking him to send over a Cybetruck for an “apples to apples test,” to which Musk replied to “bring it on.”— sunny madra (@sundeep) November 25, 2019Bring it on https://t.co/pCnln1NdRO— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 25, 2019Despite Musk’s test, Ford F-series trucks are still the best-selling cars in the United States. On the other hand, Musk’s demonstration last week didn’t hinder the Cybertruck sales, as Tesla reportedly received almost 150,000 pre-orders in under three days.Before You Continue…For the best experience possible, we and our partners collect usage information and use cookies to show you relevant advertising.
