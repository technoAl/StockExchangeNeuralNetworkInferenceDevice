NVIDAI has added a new Tesla V100s Compute Accelerator towards their product stack. NVIDIA Tesla V100 Tensor Core is the most advanced data center GPU ever built to accelerate AI, high performance computing (HPC), data science and graphics. It’s powered by NVIDIA Volta architecture, comes in 16 and 32GB configurations, and offers the performance of up to 100 CPUs in a single GPU. Data scientists, researchers, and engineers can now spend less time optimizing memory usage and more time designing the next AI breakthrough. With 640 Tensor Cores, Tesla V100 is the world’s first GPU to break the 100 teraFLOPS (TFLOPS) barrier of deep learning performance. The next generation of NVIDIA NVLink™ connects multiple V100 GPUs at up to 300 GB/s to create the world’s most powerful computing servers. AI models that would consume weeks of computing resources on previous systems can now be trained in a few days. With this dramatic reduction in training time, a whole new world of problems will now be solvable with AI. Tesla V100 is engineered to provide maximum performance in existing hyperscale server racks. With AI at its core, Tesla V100 GPU delivers 47X higher inference performance than a CPU server. This giant leap in throughput and efficiency will make the scale-out of AI services practical.
