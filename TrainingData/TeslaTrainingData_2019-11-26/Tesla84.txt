Videos of Tesla cars zipping around in full auto mode and Waymo's public passenger pilot in Arizona quickly deflate the idea that the software powering driverless cars is not viable. But we're not quite ready for a more autonomous transit system just yet. While some of our cars are quite smart indeed, much of our infrastructure is stuck in the Stone Age.The problem is that driverless cars don't have a great way to communicate with the physical environment right now. After all, autonomous driving is not just a question of geonavigating a vehicle from point A to point B. It's a dynamic feat where the decisions a car must make will constantly change depending on things like the weather, the actions of other cars, and unexpected roadway intruders.For a while, policymakers focused on what's called "vehicle-to-vehicle" (V2V) communications systems as a way to give autonomous vehicles sharper vision. V2V tech focuses on intercar sensing, which would allow autonomous vehicles to detect and avoid each other.Engineers had already been working on these technologies by the late-1990s, but in true government fashion, regulators put most of their eggs and funding behind a single technology standard, Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC), which was far from comprehensive enough to do the trick. After all, the armadillos that scurry across desert highways will not have receptors on their shells.Today, engineers complement V2V technologies with a broader suite of what's called "vehicle-to-infrastructure" (V2I) transmission mechanisms, which would allow vehicles to also communicate with the physical world around them—through antennas, sensors, and cameras affixed to things like utility poles.Policymakers are slowly but surely coming around to the understanding that emerging technologies will need more of this kind of "street furniture" to navigate our more connected world. Smart cars, drones, 5G connectivity, and "smart city" applications all need physical networking in order to properly function.So the question becomes: how can we make sure that our dumb infrastructure gets smart enough in time for these technologies to roll out?This is the problem that Brent Skorup and Korok Ray considered in their recent Mercatus Center study, called "Smart Cities, Dumb Infrastructure: Policy-Induced Competition in Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Systems."State and local governments are going to have to get smart about how they incentivize street furniture installation and monetization. Skorup and Ray suggest a public-private hybrid. Municipalities should tap private companies to install the equipment, with one catch: open access must be baked in, so that different applications and technologies can benefit from the same infrastructure.Skorup and Ray outline three broad categories of street furniture that we'll need: 1) basic infrastructure, which includes "passive" structures like utility poles, cabinets, wiring, and the rights-of-way necessary to install such structures; 2) network infrastructure, which is long-lasting networking equipment like fiber cables and data networks; and 3) the devices themselves, like cameras and roadside sensors.To provide autonomous vehicle coverage across the nation, we'll need a lot of those things. A survey by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) projects that some 250,000 traffic signal locations (around 80 percent) should be V2I-enabled by 2040, and another 25,000 non-signal roadside locations will also be online. Then we'll need "accurate, real-time, localized traveler information" on around 90 percent of our roadways, and ideally more.That's a lot of smart lights. And they will necessitate competent planning from the hundreds or thousands of nested municipalities that fund, oversee, and install such infrastructure across the US. Needless to say, this is a rather tall order.A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report from 2015 dives into exactly what barriers stand in the way of such installing connectivity from sea to shining sea. Setting aside the spectrum management issues, GAO points out that many states and local agencies simply lack the knowledge and resources to adequately deploy and manage the enormous amount of smart infrastructure needed to power these more autonomous roadways.Okay, so why not let private businesses take the lead? State and local governments already routinely contract the installation and maintenance of old-school telecommunications infrastructure to private companies. Couldn't Uber or GM or Google just duke it out amongst each other to provide infrastructure services for different locales?Well, they probably could, but it would almost certainly introduce inefficiencies. The GAO notes that a key factor to smart infrastructure success will be "interoperability." Much of the street furniture that can fuel better smart car coverage could also serve 5G coverage, or drone communications, or even better garbage truck management.Even if the networking equipment itself is incompatible, the rights-of-way that a company gets to install, say, a utility pole could also hoist up a 5G antenna. Granting a little networking fiefdom to a single private company could deprive a community of the benefits of open access, which means our environments would be much dumber than they needed to be.If policymakers proceed thoughtfully now, we can spare ourselves an artificially dumber infrastructure future. Skorup and Ray outline a model that they call "policy-induced competition" to overcome the dual problems of municipal limitations and private street furniture-hoarding.Under policy-induced competition, governments would solicit bids for companies to install, maintain, and profit from certain kinds of smart infrastructure, just like they do for other kinds of networking equipment. But the governments would require winning firms to build access into certain categories of equipment.Here's a good example of policy-induced competition: gas pumps. When you go to fill up your car, you don't need to worry about finding a "Honda nozzle" or a "GM gas pump" that will be compatible with your car. You just pull up to any gas station and know that the equipment will be compatible with your car. This didn't happen on its own, but was the result of a government requirement that all gas nozzles are the same size.With street furniture, contracts to install or manage basic infrastructure (like utility poles) would come with requirements that the equipment is accessible to other companies and uses so that the community reaps the full benefits of these installations. The devices themselves—things like 5G equipment and cameras—don't lend themselves to interoperability mandates, and would be almost totally left in the hands of the private sector. Networking equipment is probably too complex for interoperability, too, but the authors leave open the possibility that policy-induced competition may make sense for this category of equipment in some circumstances.Right now, state and local governments don't have much of a plan at all for how their municipalities will roll out the ample amounts of infrastructure and equipment necessary for not only smart cars, but also super-fast wireless coverage and smart city technologies. But the longer they wait to get their ducks in a row, the farther away the future of driverless cars will be.Let's not waste our super-smart transit technologies on a dumb and unworkable infrastructure. If municipal planners get serious about implementing policy-induced competition now, our streets just might get smart enough to meet the challenges of our networked future in time.

Report abuses.So what’s the deaths and injuries per million miles for self-driving cars vs. human driven ones?I rather doubt that autonomous vehicles across all companies making them have a total of a million miles driving on real roads with regular traffic.  Any number you could get at this point would be statistically meaningless.STOP SPENDING OUR TAXPAYER MONEY!!!!!!This is a good article with good idea but what will be the cost to the public?  Cities have a hard time maintaining infrastructure now and this additional infrastructure is likely to be even more costly.  You can attempt to shift the cost to the private sector but I suspect one way or another it will come back to the public as taxes or rate hikes for services.  Are we ready to take on these costs?As with electric cars, the poorer people in the country will pay a subsidy to the wealthy.Don’t ya just love it when libertarian magazines publish articles recommending top down, government-driven central planning solutions ?I can handle reading things that I don’t agree with from time to time.  Technological optimism is one of Reason’s big topics.  And whether and to what extent government should build and maintain roads and other infrastructure is a big debate among libertarians.Not among libertarians.  Among statists who can only think of top-down central planning.A lot of libertarians are also statists.This is also policy wonk shit about things that might actually happen rather than libertarian idealism.  Which you seem to acknowledge below.Libertarianism is accepting of tiny and limited government as a necessary evil. Big difference between that and a statist who advocates massive government control over social and economic affairs.He’s simply wrong.  The two are diametrically opposed and whatever he used to get to his conclusion should never be consulted again.“A lot of libertarians are also statists.”You mean like some shrimp are jumbo?So is abortion. It’s funny how Libertarianism is a big tent philosophy where it’s adherents proclaim that this batch of government money or this class of coercion is ok. I mean, it’s pretty much like calling yourself a libertarian doesn’t mean anything besides being a gun nut who doesn’t want rich people to pay taxes. I guess those last two things are sacrosanct so it’s good that we believe in at least something in this topsy-turvy world.Pay your mortgage and fuck off.Technological optimism is one of Reason’s big topics.Sure, but it’s rather orthogonal to anything resembling a libertarian topic. Unless… And whether and to what extent government should build and maintain roads and other infrastructure is a big debate among libertarians.No, it’s not. There are some utilitarians, optimistic futurists, and even statists that debate the issue, but the linking libertarian sentiment among them is largely ‘muh roadz’ and the fact that the while the government can and does, it isn’t needed or required to make roads happen.Herein lies the rub, as I mention further down the thread, discussion of alloying steel and building railroads isn’t anti-libertarian, but when you talk about current technology specifically to enable further government intervention policy-induced competition, you’re pretty decidedly in anti-libertarian territory.Being optimistic about the future isn’t anti-libertarian, optimistically dreaming up how the future government can induce competition in as-yet unfounded technological field through policy is exceedingly statist and anti-libertarian.As much as this article’s slobbering over central planning disgusts me, I am not convinced it takes that side; it can be read as more of a review of current planning, not what the author or magazine) want.Luckily for us, reason is NOT a libertarian publication.I can’t wait to see an autonomous vehicle try to navigate my private, half-mile long, winding and frequently washed-out lane.Yeah, I’ll believe it when I see them doing my drive to work in a snow storm.Given the limitations on my own vehicle’s sensors in bad weather, I would like to see how a Tesla does in full auto mode in a snowstorm.  Driving in perfect conditions does not prove viability in areas where those do not exist all the time.This is nonsense.  Central planning doesn’t work, and if the only way to get autonomous vehicles is nu cramming roadways full of 5G signals, there won’t be enough bandwidth or processing power available to do the trick.Humans get by pretty darned well with just one or two low-power eyeballs reading street signs and scanning for other vehicles, pedestrians, and armadillos.  If computers can’t do that yet, then autonomous driving is not ready yet.  Even if all that 5G infrastructure were in place, autonomous driving still requires vehicle awareness of pedestrians and armadillos, and that’s the hard part.Or to put it another way, recognizing and understanding street signs and signals lights is the easiest part of autonomous driving.  Using 5G for that is a waste, and frankly just another excuse to spend my taxes on a bloated and expanding bureaucracy.How about we give an example. Self Driving cars were implemented perfectly in the first Grand Theft Auto game in 1997. Not just one car, but an entire city full of them, all following road instructions perfectly until the play comes and messes them up. However, that is because they are in the computer, the computer can perfectly know what every sign means.The problem with self-driving cars has always been sensing the road. Every attempt to fix that is either fiendishly difficult or an attempt to reinvent the train.Sensing the road is trivial compared to sensing pedestrians and armadillos.  Autonomous cars have a long way to go.I can see you know very little, because road conditions are not trivial at all.pretty much all of that. Reason’s obsession with self driving cars has always puzzled me.“just one or two low-power eyeballs”The bandwidth of vision is approximately equivalent to terabytes.  Low power is wrong.This headline should have been the lead-in to a story about a VC firm attempting to buy roads from states or municipalities or voluntarily placing sensors to enable new tech systems. But it isn’t.our streets just might get smart enough to meet the challenges of our networked future in timefor the next Carrington Event.What is the cost of smart roads versus smart drivers? I’m not talking about Johnny Cabs, I’m talking about Uber. Is the smart roads thing a solution in search of a problem?So Called ‘smart cars’ are yet one more techie idea that I think will be a disaster in real world. To err is human. To replicate that error ten thousand times a second requires a computer. I have dealt with buggy software some 56k was a lot of memory, and I have zero faith that smart cars will not turn out to be death traps.I’d agree if the current solution wasn’t to have average people driving all the cars.  They are unquestionably worse.worldwide:Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. An additional 20-50 million are injured or disabled.The number is about 40k dead in the US, and about 4.5 million “seriously injured”.Those are pretty easy numbers to beat, which is the true metric.Of course, nobody is going to use that metric.  I’m quite certain we’ll go with “it killed a 2 year old on a tricycle!!!” as the metric, and the other 4.5 million folks who were not seriously injured or killed can go pound sand, because the blame for that is diffuse.I know people drive like idiots. I’m all too often one of them, though I try to keep in mind that I’m a poor driver at all times. What concerns me is the software bug that suddenly turns up in a thousand cars of the same model one Monday morning commute, when all of them suddenly turn left for no readily apparent reason.See, if the car is doing the driving, the authorities can say you should be paying attention all the time in case of error, but that just ain’t gonna happen.When you consider that the hundreds of millions of drivers drive trillions of miles every year in every imaginable condition, those numbers are going to be quite hard to beat. Driving is not a very dangerous thing to do.Whenever someone says something is “unquestionable” then provides data that shows it is quite questionable i have to chuckle.This is a solved problem.  And these companies already live in that space –  tech companies cooperate on standards all the time.  The web page you are looking at is the result of one of these cooperative efforts.If the government wants to help things along, they could probably set up some standards body or another, but the best thing would be to be as hands off as possible and let the industry players work it out, then support whatever they decide to do.“…Couldn’t Uber or GM or Google just duke it out amongst each other to provide infrastructure services for different locales? Well, they probably could, but it would almost certainly introduce inefficiencies…”Which is a very good indication that the entire enterprise should be ignored until the market says we need it.Couldn’t we just start working on something akin to a pneumatic tube system, like in Futurama  At least my taxes would make going to work be fun.With street furniture, contracts to install or manage basic infrastructure (like utility poles) would come with requirements that the equipment is accessible to other companies and uses so that the community reaps the full benefits of these installations.Tom Johnson knew exactly how to get around that when he owned private street car companies. Just merge all the companies who acquire the contracts and hey presto – the private entity has their monopoly again. It’s why he became one of the best mayors in US history. He knew exactly how everything he wanted to do for the community could actually be undermined because he understood the actual value of municipal assets. Course that meant he didn’t sell those assets off for cheap either. The only way to ensure operational competition then was to maintain muni ownership of some asset that couldn’t be privatized and reassembled into a private monopoly. Course it was easy to demonize that approach as ‘municipal socialism’. We no longer in the US have the concept of ‘good government’. Nor do we much care about competition now either. Just eliminating it so our side can ensure a win.Notably missing in that V2V and V2I is V2P. Something as simple as ‘right turn on red’ pretty much eliminated drivers actually looking right before they turned right and thus eliminated pedestrians from being able to claim a de facto right to cross the road. Medoubts that Americans who program that V2 tech will start giving a shit about the ‘people’ part now either“…Something as simple as ‘right turn on red’ pretty much eliminated drivers actually looking right before they turned right and thus eliminated pedestrians from being able to claim a de facto right to cross the road…” Bullshit.“This didn’t happen on its own, but was the result of a government requirement that all gas nozzles are the same size.”That isn’t quite true.  What happened was that EPA banned leaded gasoline and then set a maximize size for unleaded nozzles so that cars could be sold that would not accept leaded gasoline nozzles.Which federal regulation specifies the dimensions of a USB port?How is a cartel that much different than govt?Sarc or stupidity? A cartel can’t put you in jail.By this point, driverless car technology has few skeptics. Videos of Tesla cars zipping around in full auto mode and Waymo’s public passenger pilot in Arizona quickly deflate the idea that the software powering driverless cars is not viable.Huh, apparently, someone hasn ‘t been paying attention to videos of Tesla cars careening around parking lots and decapitating their drivers.Because driverless cars are NOT working very well– which is why all of the industry players (except Tesla) have mostly abandoned all but level 5 driverless technology (realizing correctly that anything less is dangerous) the only way this will ever work is with a massive ground-based telemetry system, as I’ve commented repeatedly on these here threads.  And that’s going to be very expensive, and a long time coming.A ground-based telemetry system also means that the cars would be useless outside of cities because nobody is going to invest in building that infrastructure out in Hicksville. You’re advocating for the “smart road” approach, but there are a lot of folks looking at this who say it is the wrong approach to go because we will never reach the point where the roads and guidance systems have the information needed. These people argue that you need to assume the roads and external guidance will be dumb and build systems that can deal with that in a fault-tolerant manner. The two approaches aren’t necessarily contradictory in that a smart car could use smart roads and telemetry when available and rely on its own sensors when that’s not there. But, if you design cars to *require* that infrastructure, they will fail when the infrastructure falls short, loses power, or has any fault.That tells me that relying on the ground-based telemetry approach is problematic compared to designing cars that can work in our current “dumb” infrastructure.I suspect it will ultimately be even more limited than that. Anything with a higher velocity than about 20 mph is ultimately constrained by how much we value a human life. Cuz that human is not automatable and the vehicle likely wins in any collision with said human. So any public land with a higher velocity than that will de facto eliminate humans from access.Of course, I suppose its possible that said robocar could be configured with a giant spike coming out of the steering wheel with seat belts strapping the passenger to those spikes. Or maybe the only seats are exposed right on the front bumper so the vehicle owner actually becomes the most likely victim in a crash. Methinks that wouldn’t sell too well. But other than that scenario, all the ‘safety’ improvements would be designed to improve the safety of that owner at the direct expense of every other human.If the driverless cars are so much smarter than human drivers, why do they need $billions worth of technology that humans get along without?Or, we could just forget this stupid idea.It is a very niche thing that’ll only work in only a few areas for the foreseeable future. After all, autonomous driving is not just a question of geonavigating a vehicle from point A to point B. It’s a dynamic feat where the decisions a car must make will constantly change depending on things like the weather, the actions of other cars, and unexpected roadway intruders.Actually, there are more problems geonavigating a vehicle from point A to point B then just the dynamic factors no on a map.GPS precision and what level of GPS is being used in the vehicle.Consumer grade GPS is inexpensive, but precision can vary with conditions, including season, weather, land topography and proximity to large artificial structures*.  Precision ranges from within 4 meters to within 32 meters,enough to actually miss a road, and even 4 meters isn’t sufficient to hold lane position.Map grade GPS can get you to within 1 meter, but the receivers cost upwards of $1,000 each.Survey grade GPS can get you to sub centimeter precision, but the receivers cost upwards  of $10,000 each.Then there’s the map data itself, which is never 100% accurate.  There are documented instances of crashes or people driving off the ends of roads into bodies of water because a human driver was paying more attention to their GPS navigation system than to their surroundings.The idea that an autonomous vehicle could rely on geonavigating from GPS data just to stay on the road without using local sensor data like cameras is laughable.*Large metal and/or glass structures can reflect GPS signals making the receiver think it’s farther from a given satellite than it really is, throwing of the triangulation calculations used to determine the units position.  Higher grades of GPS use more satellites at once so they aren’t as affected by this.GPS won’t cut it.  It needs machine vision and in the end, a massive ground-based telemetry system so the environment can communicate with the car.  This will be a combination of sensors by the road, under the road (in some cases– complex intersections, urban environments) and two-way communications telling the car what the condition of the traffic and roadway is etc.Self-driving technology will happen, but it’s a long, long way out.  The idea we have all the technology we need to stuff into the car and only the car to be able to navigate the world– that’s laughable.The idea we have all the technology we need to stuff into the car and only the car to be able to navigate the world– that’s laughable.Kinda why I wish Reason were a little more pragmatic or honest in it’s science reporting or futurism. Borrowing from Heinlein*; I’m fine with discussions on railroads, but the confusion induced by discussing how to alloy steel so that the government can construct railroads for everyone’s benefit is exceedingly irritating from a libertarian standpoint. The fact that, depending on the author, I’m being generous assuming the confusion is being accidentally induced makes it all the more aggravating.*”When railroading time comes you can railroad—but not before.”We have a word for geonavigating.  Its called navigating.The biggest impediment would seem to be lawyers. One wonders how it only took about 35 years to develop a national paved road system for the early autos.Is anyone else getting the feeling that the whole smart cars vs. smart roads debate has been a huge bait and switch?For the longest time smart roads were going to be too expensive and weren’t going to work for most of our infrastructure, so smart cars were the ‘only’ option. Now, it seems like smart cars won’t entirely fit the bill and we’re going to need at least some smart roads as well.Smart cars weren’t the solution to whatever problem they didn’t solve, they were the solution to the problem of getting taxpayers to foot the bill for more surveillance and smart road technology.“By this point, driverless car technology has few skeptics.”Narrator “she’s drunk” Please log in to post comments  Ronald Bailey  | 11.26.2019 10:15 AM  Robby Soave  | 11.26.2019 10:00 AM  Elizabeth Nolan Brown  | 11.26.2019 9:40 AM  David Post  | 11.26.2019 9:27 AM  Eugene Volokh  | 11.26.2019 8:03 AMPolice AbuseGreen Angel CBD had the proper documentation for their shipment, but that didn't stop the New York cops.
