A featherweight boxer weighed in three weight classes above his opponent just a day before his world-title eliminator on Saturday, prompting him to be pulled from the fight and kicked out of his hotel by the promoter. The Mexican Andres Gutierrez was set to face off against his countryman Oscar Valdez on Saturday in Las Vegas to decide who would earn a shot at the WBC super-featherweight world-title holder Miguel Berchelt.But just a day before the bout, Gutierrez stepped on the scales at an astonishing 11 pounds over the 130-pound limit, making him eligible to compete at welterweight.Bob Arum, the fight's promoter, was enraged with the 26-year-old, calling the situation a "disgrace.""We're throwing him out of the hotel," Arum said after the weigh-in, according to the BBC. "I have seen guys 2 or 3 pounds over weight, that is still unprofessional."But to come in at 11 pounds overweight is a disgrace — I have never seen anything like it."The WBC's president, Mauricio Sulaiman, also condemned Gutierrez, suggesting on Twitter that he had been trying to dehydrate himself to cut weight in the buildup to the fight."This is absolutely a clear indication of dangerous tactic by Gutierrez to cut weight," he wrote. "Weight management program is a top priority for WBC and this case will be fully investigated to its fullest consequences."Sulaiman confirmed in a separate tweet that Gutierrez had been officially suspended by the WBC.Gutierrez was replaced at the last minute by the American Adam Lopez, who was subsequently beaten by Valdez via a seventh-round technical knockout.
