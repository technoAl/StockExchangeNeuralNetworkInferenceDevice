Tesla plans to start manufacturing the Cybertruck around late-2021.Even with Model 3’s bigger deposit there was high churn, Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. “$100 deposit for the truck? That’s fluffy. Just a fluffy order number.”The US pickup truck market is one of the world’s most profitable vehicle segments and is dominated by Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler.Technology reviewer Marques Brownlee called the Cybertruck a “tech-world disruptor” and said for Tesla to enter the pick-up truck market, it had to stand out.From touting the features of Cybertruck to taking a dig at Ford’s F-150 pickup truck, Musk has been tweeting furiously to boost sales since Thursday’s launch.Tesla delivers record number of electric cars“Better truck than an F-150, faster than a Porsche 911,” he tweeted over the weekend, posting a video of the Cybertruck dragging the F-150 uphill.Musk has long been using his 30 million Twitter following as a platform to sell Tesla’s vehicles but landed in trouble last year when he tweeted he would take Tesla private before withdrawing the statement.As a result, he agreed with US regulators to submit his public statements about the company to vetting by legal counsel. Tesla did not respond to Reuters’ inquiries as to whether all of the tweets had been vetted. Musk claimed the truck’s “ultra-hard” exterior “won’t scratch and dent”It will also create an engineering and design center in the cityMore than half the cars produced by Porsche will be electric by 2025
