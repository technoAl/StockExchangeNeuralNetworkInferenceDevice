If you've been eyeing that discounted MacBook Pro or iPhone 11, now's the perfect time to grab them while the deals are still available. You can even save $100 on a HomePod and $150 on Beats Studio3 Wireless headphones. Some of the earlier deals at major retailers sold out super fast, so we're keeping this post updated when any hot Apple devices get restocked. Pro tip: Best Buy, Amazon, other major retailers and your cellular carrier are the best places to look -- not the Apple Store. That said, Apple is having its own Cyber Monday shopping event focused on gift cards up to $200 with purchase, so if you're interested in making multiple Apple purchases, those might come in handy. Otherwise, we suggest sticking with other major vendors: Apple's gift-card incentive doesn't beat any of the deals listed below.  We'll keep updating this Apple guide with new deals as we discover them. And while you're shopping, we have ideas for how to keep your stress level manageable. Visit our Holiday Survival Guide for tips on how to battle the shopping crowds without too much strain on your emotional state and your pocketbook.       Now that Target's inventory has run dry, Amazon has the lowest price, $299, on the brand-new 10.2-inch iPad, which has a larger screen but is otherwise nearly identical to its 2018 predecessor. That's not as good as the $250 deals we saw earlier, but still well under the original price.

    The new 16-inch MacBook Pro is still expensive, but even a small discount adds up, considering the usual starting price is $2,399.

    These don't say "Apple," but Apple owns the Beats brand now, and these iconic headphones are deeply discounted right now (even if $10 more than they were on Monday).

    Apple sliced $50 off the price of the HomePod back in April. But Best Buy has picked up the knife for some additional trimming. This is the lowest price we've ever seen on Apple's smart speaker. Read our Apple HomePod review.
    
    
    
    The $800 deal at Amazon appears to be gone, but you can still get the current MacBook Air for just $900 at Best Buy -- that's $200 off the Apple Store price. (To get this price, you need to be a member of the My Best Buy program, which is free to join.)
    
    
    
    Released in early November, the AirPods Pro are available for a (slightly) cheaper price. Regularly priced at $250, the small discount for the noise-canceling earbuds is great for those needing to upgrade their previous AirPods or those who want to dive into a truly wireless audio experience.

    The new AirPods are the baseline true wireless headphones. They have an open design and the fit can be finicky for some ears, but they're a significant step up from wired headphones for iPhone users.
