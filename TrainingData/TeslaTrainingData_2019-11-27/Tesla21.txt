From November 25 to December 2, Apple will donate ('https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/25/apple-pay-red-donations-2019/') $1 to (RED) for every purchase made with Apple Pay on Apple.com, the Apple Store app, and Apple retail stores, up to a total of $1 million.

Does this actually do anything about AIDs ?

The cynical part of me just looks at this as advertising for Apple.

Why not just promote the cause and donate the $1 million dollars and call it a day?

Wait - Do they have RGB giant Apple logos? Can they make it pink for October, etc.

One of iOS 13's major new features is a systemwide Dark Mode option, which matches the Dark Mode feature we got in macOS Mojave last year.
