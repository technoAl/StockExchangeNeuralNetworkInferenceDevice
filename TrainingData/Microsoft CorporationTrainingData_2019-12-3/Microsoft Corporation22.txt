Greetings, Arsians! The Dealmaster is back with another round of early Black Friday deals. Today's list is highlighted by a deal on Sony's WH-1000XM3 noise-canceling headphones, which are down below $280 at various retailers. This will be their sale price for the holiday season; normally, they retail for around $350.That said, a metric ton of Black Friday deals has gone live ahead of Black Friday proper, including a whole bunch of discounts on PS4 and Xbox One hardware, video games for those systems, Amazon Fire TV streamers and Fire tablets, the latest-gen Apple iPad, and much more. So even if you don't need a new pair of headphones, have a look through the full roundup below.Note: Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.
