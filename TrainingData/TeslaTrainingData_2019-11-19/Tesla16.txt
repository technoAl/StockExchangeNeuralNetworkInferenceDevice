Words by Jenny Brewer, Tuesday 19 November 2019School: Public Works siteEx-Hawraf co-founders and Google Creative Lab alumni Andrew Herzog and Nicky Tesla called their new creative studio School because “continual learning and experimentation are foundational pillars of their process and identity”. Their latest venture, Public Works, does so by giving a behind the scenes peek at some of the world’s top studios, by way of a live stream broadcast from inside their workplace.Much like Sagmeister & Walsh’s infamous live stream homepage but more temporary (and therefore perhaps less intrusive), the project will focus on a different studio every month and hopes to share insight to their working culture and the reality of day-to-day creativity. The hope is viewers will “glean some second-hand knowledge that’s usually only available to employees and interns,” falling in line with a trend for companies being broadly more transparent and honest with the public.The project launches today with a broadcast from inside New York environmental design firm Food, which creates everything from office and store interiors to stage designs, and has previously collaborated with Off-White, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, Yeezy, MoMA, The New Museum, Bauhaus Museum, Arup, 2×4, Nike and Adidas, as well as working on the New York public swimming concept, +Pool. The broadcast will show the team’s pin-up sessions, model making, and, as School explains, “whatever else an architecture firm does”. After the live stream finishes, School will archive the footage on the Public Works site so viewers can rewatch.School: Public Works siteSchool: Public Works siteSchool: Public Works siteFood: Yeezus stageFood: Off-White Hong KongSchool: Public Works logohttps://publicwooooorks.tv/Creative inspiration delivered direct to your inbox.
