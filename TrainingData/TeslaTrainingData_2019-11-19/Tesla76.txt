The ads here ran on national TV for the first time over the weekend (Nov. 15-17).A few highlights: Wells Fargo wants you to know that it’s now collecting donations of food at all its branches in partnership with Feeding America. (A longer web version of this ad debuted on YouTube on Nov. 7.) Idris Elba helps Ford hype a new electric car. (E.J. Schultz has the backstory on the campaign: “How Ford is taking on Tesla with its Mustang Mach-E.”) And Verizon drums up excitement for its 5G Ultra Wideband network.Data provided by iSpot.tv, TV Ad Measurement for Disruptive BrandsIn this article:
