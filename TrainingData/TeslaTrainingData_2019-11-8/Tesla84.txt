Can you beat a Tesla Model X off the line with a seven-year old SUV that’s completely stock? Well, if it’s got a Porsche badge on it, then you can at least try…This drag race comes courtesy of The Fast Lane Car YouTube channel, and sees a new $87,000 Tesla Model X dual-motor (not the P100D) line up alongside a 2012 Porsche Cayenne Turbo, which cost a great deal less to purchase.Also watch: Tesla Model 3 Vs Alfa Romeo Giulia QV, Place Your BetsThe owner of this 2012 Cayenne Turbo stated that he paid just $22,000 for it, which is actually a great price for this exact spec and model year. It’s also roughly four times less than what the Model X costs, and while we’re pretty much comparing apples to oranges (ICE vs Electric), the two SUVs are quite similar from a performance standpoint.So then is the Tesla four times better than the Porsche if all you care about is speed? Of course not. Not even the P100D could lay claim to such a thing. As for it simply being quicker, well, you’re just a click away from finding that out.By the way, the 2012 Porsche Cayenne Turbo (pre-facelift second-gen model) is powered by a 4.8-liter twin turbo V8 with 500 PS (493 HP) and 700 Nm (516 lb-ft) of torque, which gives it more than a fighting chance against its all-electric rival.
