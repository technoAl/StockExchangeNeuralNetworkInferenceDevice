Greetings coming into second week of November, where we’re looking back at the energy happenings in the first week of the month.   Here’s a brief summary of what I believe were the top five stories of last week, based on their long-term implications for our energy future.   A fleet of Teslas in California making massive mileageA shuttle service in Southern California called Tesloop is running a fleet of seven Teslas (Model Xs, 3s, and one S) with odometers on each pushing well past 300,000 miles and some close to half a million – making them some of the highest-mileage Teslas on the planet.  Quartz had a look at the maintenance logs in order to see where the costs were incurred (most fleet vehicles get sold after about 100,000 miles, so it’s tough to compare). Going the distance, with implications for the auto industrySide view of a red Tesla Model 3 electric car from Tesla Motors under a dramatic sky in the San ...

(Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)The majority of money Tesloop has spent on repairs to date involved normal wear such as brakes and windshield wipers.  There were some larger repairs – including six battery replacements – but those were covered by warranty, and one Model X had its range decline from 260 miles to an anemic 200 miles, but that was after 330,000 miles.Granted, fleet owners and taxi drivers can generally put more miles on vehicles before they go kaput than the average driver (for example, there are many reports of Prius taxis with north of 500,000 miles).  At the same time, this data suggests that a transformation to electric vehicles may have some profound impacts on the automobile industry, beyond the obvious one of carmakers having to migrate to a new platform.  Key among them is that cars may simply last longer, meaning that fewer of them will need to be manufactured in the long run.  And quite likely, the parts companies and mechanics are going to be in a world of hurt in a future where fewer parts exist (a couple dozen in the drive train, compared with hundreds in an internal combustion engine), and often last longer.Tesloop’s owner also speculates that if the lifespan of higher mileage cars can be further extended with inexpensive battery packs, these vehicles may retain considerable value.  That could have an effect on the secondary market for used internal combustion cars.  Mass introduction of new technology often has surprising and unanticipated knock-on effects.  There may be a few here with the transition to EVs that will be worth watching.Decarbonizing the grid: good news out of Australia; not so much in CaliforniaNews from Down Under that Australia’s main electricity grid hit the 50% renewables milestone last Wednesday at 11:50 AM.  At that moment, rooftop solar had its moment to shine, delivering 23.7% of the grid’s energy, followed by wind and utility-scale solar at 15.7% and 8.8% respectively, and hydro trailing at 1.9%.  Unfortunately, overall coal was still the biggest boy on the block, with black coal at 35.7%. and brown coal at 13.5%.  The writing is on the wall here, though.  Cleaner and more cost-effective renewables generation will continue to push ever harder at coal’s dominance and the renewables numbers will continue to climb for a while.  Eventually, the Australian grid - and every other one focusing on the decarbonization goal - will have to address the challenge of balancing intermittency and needing to find dispatchable resources to follow load at all times.It’s not a valid reference to Australia without a pic of kangarooCANBERRA, AUSTRALIA - OCTOBER 28: A Kangaroo jumps across a golf course in Canberra on October 28, ...

However, one thing is clear: given the historically unparalled level of uncertainty, it’s increasingly dangerous to place bets on huge assets with long lead times unless you have a firm off-taker on the other side of the equation (the offshore wind industry is taking that bet, but that’s because it has state support in building out the various East Coast projects).Bigger is better and cheaper: more news from the offshore wind sectorAnd speaking of offshore wind, Siemens Gamesa unveiled its first 10 MW offshore monster, adding the company to the likes of GE, Vestas, CSIC Haizhuang, and Dongfan Electric.  With GE’s Haliade platform already at 12 MW, it probably won’t be long before somebody steps in with a 15 MW machine.  The most exciting part of the Siemens announcement was its comment that the new turbine would provide a temporary bridge until it offers a “true step change” embodied in an as-yet “unnameplated” 1X machine sometime in 2024/25.  The offshore wind industry appears to still be in its infancy, with higher capacity factors and increasingly better levelized costs of energy in the offing.DeepWater Wind: its 6 MW machines now look punyWind turbines, of the Block Island Wind Farm, tower over the water on October 14, 2016 off the ...

It maxes out at an impressive 107 meters.  So in retrospect, they made the testing shed too small.  Such is the world we live in these days.  By the way, the first test Haliade 12 MW unit just started spinning at a port outside Rotterdam last week.If you want to know why natural gas is so cheap, it helps to know that 12% of U.S. gas production is essentially freeLast week, I wrote about the number of fracking rigs being scrapped in the U.S. owing to a glut of production, and referred to the dynamic of ‘associated gas.’  That’s gas that comes along with fracked oil for the ride.  You call it ‘associated.’  I call it ‘free.’Free gasJust after publishing last week’s piece, an email showed up in my inbox with the new Energy Information Administration Numbers.  Turns out that in the top five shale oil basins, associated gas represented 37% of total natural gas output.  Nationally, the number is 12%.  In Econ 101, we all learned that when 12% of anything is essentially free, Adam Smith’s invisible hand is going to start twitching, with the effect of muting prices until that dynamic fades.  That in turn will keep power prices low whenever gas-fired generation is setting the energy price on the margin (which is most of the time, in most markets)I'm a co-founder of NorthBridge Energy Partners, LLC., a consulting firm that helps companies connect assets to power grids.
