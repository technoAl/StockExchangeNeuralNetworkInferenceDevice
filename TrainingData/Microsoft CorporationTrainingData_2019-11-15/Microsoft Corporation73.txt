"Stranger Things" actor Noah Schnapp finally met his longtime crush Zendaya at the E! People's Choice Awards on Sunday, and fans were overjoyed that the 15-year-old star was living his dream.Schnapp and Zendaya were both nominated for awards at Sunday's ceremony. Zendaya won twice for drama TV star of 2019 and female movie star of 2019, and "Stranger Things" took home several awards as well. Photos from the event show Schnapp and Zendaya talking and laughing together, and the two even posed for a few photos — delighting fans who wanted to see Schnapp finally meet his longtime crush, whom he'd not-so-secretly carried a torch for since 2018.Some fans even expressed their concern for Schnapp's wellbeing after his encounter with Zendaya, who stars on HBO's teen drama "Euphoria." But all in all, everyone just seemed happy for the "Stranger Things" star. Schnapp has not-so-secretly had a thing for the "Spider Man: Homecoming" star for a while now. At the 2018 MTV Movie and TV Awards, the actor gushed over Zendaya, calling her "so pretty" and saying he loves her. And Schnapp even used his acceptance speech (he won for "best scared performance") to shout out Zendaya.  Unfortunately, the two didn't get a chance to meet at the MTV Movie and TV Awards, but they shared a cute interaction on Twitter nonetheless, with Zendaya calling Schnapp "adorable." "I love you so much, maybe next we can meet but for now I'll just wave to you from a distance," an excited Schnapp replied. Like what you see here?
