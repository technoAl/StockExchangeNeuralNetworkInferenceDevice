Los Angeles Clippers head coach Doc Rivers was ejected on Wednesday night after an extended argument with the referees in the final minutes of his team's game against the Houston Rockets.While on any other night, Rivers' ejection would have been just another moment in a busy day of NBA action, on Wednesday Doc was facing off against his son Austin, a guard on the Rockets. As the elder Rivers began to get into it with referee Tony Brothers, Austin took delight in the exchange and quickly began signalling for the official to give his father a technical foul.When Doc was finally ejected from the game, Rivers celebrated and encouraged the home crowd to cheer on his father's departure. By the looks of it, Austin was having an absolute ball.After the game, the younger Rivers joked about the exchange on Twitter.After the game, Austin told reporters he knew by the look in his father's eye that the ejection was the only way the argument would end."I knew it was coming," Rivers said. "I've seen that look before, many times. Once he starts blinking his eyes fast, that's when I know he's about to level up. I just started telling Tony [referee Tony Brothers] 'get him,' and they got him."On Twitter, fans took delight in the whole scene, praising Austin for getting one over on his father.While Austin joked about an awkward Thanksgiving between him and his father, the two will actually face off again just before the holiday, with Los Angeles hosting the Rockets on November 22.Hopefully father and son can bury the hatchet there so the holidays can be free of argument.No. 1 Kentucky paid Evansville $90,000 for a tune-up game and lost in one of college basketball's biggest upsets in recent memoryNFL POWER RANKINGS: Where every team stands heading into Week 11'Monday Night Football' commentator under fire after belittling criticism of 49ers kicker for missed field goalTrae Young nutmegged a defender and stared down the Nuggets bench in one of the most dominant performances of the NBA season
