Dwayne Haskins made the best throw of his young career on Sunday, but it didn't even count.In the second quarter, Haskins, making his second career start, got flushed from the pocket by the New York Jets. While on the run, Haskins tossed a floating, 67-yard bomb to rookie wide receiver Terry McLaurin, who made the catch and took it an additional 15 yards or so.Unfortunately, the play got called back because of a holding penalty on the Washington Redskins.Washington ran three more plays, didn't get a first down and punted.
