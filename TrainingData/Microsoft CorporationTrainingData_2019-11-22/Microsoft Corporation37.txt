There's no question that Dwyane Wade was an absolute legend throughout his 17-year career on the hardwood. But now that he's retired, he's taken on a new courtside role as cheerleader.Wade's son Zaire and LeBron James' son LeBron "Bronny" James Jr. began their first high-school season this year at Sierra Canyon, a private school in California. Their first game was broadcast on ESPN on Thursday, and Wade and his wife, Gabrielle Union, featured prominently on the sidelines.The duo got out of their seats and cheered when Zaire and Bronny made good plays.LeBron couldn't be at his eldest son's first high-school game because the Los Angeles Lakers had a game that evening, but he was able to stream it from the road.Dwyane, who is close friends with LeBron, reassured his buddy that he and Union had him covered on the cheering front.

Fifteen Sierra Canyon games will be broadcast on ESPN this season, and both Zaire and Bronny should figure prominently in the team's lineup.
