GLENDALE — Brendan Gallagher celebrated a milestone Wednesday and it was made more memorable when the Canadiens defeated the Arizona Coyotes 4-1.“When you have these little nights to remember, you want them to be wins,” said Gallagher, who was playing his 500th NHL game. “It was definitely good that the guys played the way they did.”Gallagher jump-started the victory when he scored 22 seconds into the first period. It set a pattern for Montreal, which scored a goal in the first two minutes of each period.“Those goals at the beginning of the periods are huge,” said Gallagher. “We know what it’s like when they go against us. It creates a lot of momentum that carries though the period and for us to start like that, those goals are big.”Gallagher appeared surprised later in the first period when the Coyotes recognized his milestone on the scoreboard.“I wasn’t expecting that,” he said. “I’ve never seen that before. It was something they didn’t have to do but I certainly appreciated it.”

Shea Weber scored 24 seconds into the second period after Arizona goaltender Antti Raanta lost a skate blade.“I’ve seen it happen before but I’ve never seen it result in a goal,” said Carey Price, who made 33 saves for the win.When Price was asked whether he felt a bit sorry for Raanta, he replied: “Not at the time.”The Canadiens needed two shifts to score a goal early in the third period and Jonathan Drouin did his best Gallagher imitation as he went to the net and banged in a rebound off a shot by Joel Armia.

“Those goals in close have been Gallagher’s bread and butter forever but we’re seeing that Jonathan Drouin is slowly turning the corner and playing good hockey,” said coach Claude Julien. “It’s encouraging to see him doing different things. He’s said himself that it’s hard to score goals from the outside and it’s good to see him go to the net and be rewarded.“As a coach, these are the things you like to see guys buy into it and you encourage them to do it more,” said Julien. “He could have skated by and turned away but he put on the brakes and stuck with it and got a goal. The more players we have doing that, the better for us.”It was Drouin’s sixth goal and he’s tied with Gallagher and Armia for the team lead.The Canadiens’ final goal featured a slick pass from rookie Nick Suzuki to Nick Cousins.

“When we were on the bench, I asked him if he heard me calling for the puck and he said he saw me,” said Cousins.“That’s probably at the top of the list,” Cousins said when asked where the goal rated among his career highlights. “I really wanted that goal.”That’s because he was hoping to score against the Coyotes, who declined to offer him a contract in June as he was coming off a career season.

 Julien said he was pleased to see the fourth line of Cousins, Nate Thompson and Suzuki contributing to the offence.“Thompson’s a 35-year-old veteran that’s playing pretty good hockey right now,” said Julien. “He’s skating well and making good decisions with the puck. He’s got a young guy on his right side [Nick Suzuki] that I think he’s bringing along really, really well. On the left side, you’ve got a little bit of grit with [Nick] Cousins. As much as he has grit, he has pretty decent hands too. He can make some good plays. We’ve got a good combination there. For us, I think our goal is you need scoring from different lines and the more you have, the better it is. Right now we’ve had production from all four lines and that’s been a big help for us this year.”phickey@postmedia.comTwitter.com/zababes1 Postmedia is pleased to bring you a new commenting experience.
