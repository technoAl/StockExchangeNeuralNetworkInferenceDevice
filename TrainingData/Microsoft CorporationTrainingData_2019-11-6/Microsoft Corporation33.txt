The Game Awards 2019 kick off next month on December 12th, and show creator and host Geoff Keighley has revealed this year's full list of nominees. It looks like Control and The Outer Worlds have been quite popular with a lot of people, as has Death Stranding, despite its divisive reception. Gears 5 nabbed three nominations for Best Audio Design, Best Performance, and Best Action Game.You'll notice a couple of recent releases are notably left out, including Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Pokémon Sword and Shield. That's because the cutoff date for eligibility was November 15th, the day they all released. Unfortunately, the voting committee did not have enough hands-on time with any of them to be considered.
