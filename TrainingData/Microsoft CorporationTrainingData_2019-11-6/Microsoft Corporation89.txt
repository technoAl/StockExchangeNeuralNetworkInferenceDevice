Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have put forward the two most ambitious plans in the Democratic primary field to tax the wealth of the richest Americans and shrink their giant fortunes.Both Sanders and Warren aim to sharply curb the economic power that the superrich have amassed in recent decades — and use the money to finance new social programs like "Medicare for All" and tuition-free college to benefit working-class Americans.Research has found that the nation's riches are increasingly confined at the top of the economic pyramid.Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, economists who have provided analysis for both Warren and Sanders' campaigns, found that the 400 richest Americans had more wealth than the 150 million adults in the bottom 60% of wealth distribution, The Washington Post reported in February."Wealth for the ordinary American family is safety. It allows you to absorb economic shocks such as losing a job," Saez told Business Insider. "At the top, wealth is no longer about insurance — it's really about power. Having a lot of wealth allows you to have disproportionate influence on society."Warren is seeking to redistribute capitalism's rewards to a larger share of the population. Her plan would kick in at $50 million, with households paying a 2% annual tax on their assets like stocks, paintings, yachts, and homes, ramping up to 6% for households with fortunes over $1 billion.It's distinct from Sanders' plan, which focuses on the existence of billionaires. The Vermont senator would impose a 1% annual tax on net worths of $32 million, gradually increasing to 8% on fortunes above $10 billion.However, since Warren recently increased her plan's top tax rate to 6% from 3%, both plans are now "almost identical" in terms of possible revenue generation and overall redistributive effects, Saez said.Critics have argued that the taxes wouldn't be effective because they would harm economic growth. Economists have also argued that the wealthy people subject to the taxes would use accounting to evade them and shelter their assets.With that in mind, here's how much smaller the fortunes of the richest 11 US citizens would be if Sanders' or Warren's proposed wealth tax had been around since 1982, the first year Forbes magazine started estimating wealth.These figures assume no evasion rate and are based on estimates from Saez and Zucman.Net worth under Warren's revised wealth tax: $7.8 billionNet worth under Sanders' wealth tax: $5 billionNet worth under Warren's revised wealth tax: $12.3 billionNet worth under Sanders' wealth tax: $11.3 billionEarlier this year, Bloomberg suggested that a wealth tax could be unconstitutional and raised the prospect of America turning into Venezuela.Net worth under Warren's revised wealth tax: $21.4 billionNet worth under Sanders' wealth tax: $19 billionNet worth under Warren's revised wealth tax: $7.9 billionNet worth under Sanders' wealth tax: $8 billionDavid Koch died in August, and it is unclear what will happen to his estate.
