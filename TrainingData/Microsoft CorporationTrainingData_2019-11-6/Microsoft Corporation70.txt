Online courses at Udemy are on sale starting at $9.99 during Cyber Week, essentially combining Black Friday and Cyber Monday into one event and extending it by a few more days. Expect to find classes in graphic design, accounting, personal development, and more on the online learning platform starting at $9.99 during Cyber Week.You'll need to use two different codes depending on when you decide to take advantage of the deal — "UDEAFFBFS19" if you're ordering from November 22 to November 29 and "UDEAFFCMW19" if you're ordering between December 2 and December 6. There are classes that help develop hard and soft skills, and in every category you can think of from graphic design to accounting and personal development.  It's worth noting that while the site's list prices often hover around $100, Udemy frequently offers deals with prices as low as $11 throughout the year. This Black Friday and Cyber Monday sale is still the best price we've seen recently, but it's certainly not unheard of on the platform. For more of Black Friday deals, find our master list of the best Black Friday deals on the internet here.
