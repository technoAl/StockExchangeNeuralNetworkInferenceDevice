Since ascending to the throne after the death of his father, King Bhumibol, in 2016, King Maha Vajiralongkorn has assumed more direct control over palace affairs and money, Reuters reported.His official coronation, which took place this May, reportedly cost the Thai government $31 million and involved him wearing a 16-pound crown topped with an Indian diamond.Earlier this month he also issued an emergency royal decree to assume personal control over two key army units, without explaining what the emergency was.Though the king is technically commander-in-chief of the country's forces, the new decree bypassed the usual military chain of command.The latest sackings are giving the world a rare glimpse into Thai palace life. The country has strict lèse-majesté laws, which means it's illegal to insult, defame, or threaten any member of the royal family.Like what you see here?
