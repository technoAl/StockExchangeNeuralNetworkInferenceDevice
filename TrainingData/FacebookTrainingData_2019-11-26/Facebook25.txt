Actress Jada Pinkett Smith revealed on Monday's episode of "Red Table Talk" that her husband Will Smith sometimes makes "insensitive" comments about their daughter Willow's periods. "Willow has gone at her dad several times for very insensitive comments, whether it's around menstruation or, you know, 'You must be PMS-ing,'" the talk show host said. "And she's like, 'That right there, we're not gonna do that,'" Pinkett Smith continued, adding, "Every day, it's a work in progress." According to the actress, who was interviewing the rapper TI about his controversial comments regarding his teenage daughter's virginity, her husband is a "joker" who frequently needs to be corrected by his family members for his insensitive or hurtful comments.  Pinkett Smith said she understood TI's confusion about how his comments were received. "I understood that because I'm in this house with Will and he be saying the craziest stuff. He don't understand the level," she explained."And thank God he has me and he's got Willow," Pinkett Smith added. "We educate that joker before he leaves this house. You know what I mean?" A representative for Will Smith didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.While on "Red Table Talk," TI defended his decision to accompany his teenage daughter Deyjah to the gynecologist to make sure her hymen was still intact — which sparked a significant amount of backlash after he spoke about it recently. "If my son goes out and gets a girl pregnant, how is the household changed for those nine months? The household does not necessarily change for those nine months," the rapper explained to Pinkett Smith on Monday's episode. "Whereas if my daughter comes home [pregnant], my household is changed almost immediately," he continued, adding, "The stakes are higher." Like what you see here?
