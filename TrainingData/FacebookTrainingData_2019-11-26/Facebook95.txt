‘Based off of the genocide of indigenous people’ As Thanksgiving draws near, The College Fix visited Macalester College in Minnesota to ask students if it’s acceptable to celebrate the holiday.Most of the students said no, and several gave a qualified yes, that being it’s okay to celebrate Thanksgiving as long as one keeps in mind the oppression it represents or that it’s more about spending time with family than honoring the past.For those who said no, they mainly focused on themes such as oppression and colonization.“I think that Thanksgiving has been misconstrued a lot, especially in textbooks,” one student told The College Fix. “It’s kind of just based off of the genocide of indigenous people and I don’t really think that we actually give thanks on Thanksgiving, we just eat a bunch of food and it’s just a bunch of capitalist bullshit.”A few students took this a step further, explaining how they believe most American holidays are rooted in oppression.“What do Americans do except for celebrate unethical holidays,” one student said. Another student interviewed outside the campus chapel said that no holidays with religious connotations should be observed.After spending several hours speaking with students, The College Fix found only a handful who unabashedly supported Thanksgiving.Watch the video:Like The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on TwitterPlease fill out all required fields.
