In an interview with Cinema5D, Sigma confirmed it’s bringing a firmware update to its full-frame fp camera that will add LOG picture profile and RAW recording over HDMI.The interview with Takuma Wakamatsu, Sigma’s product planner, took place during Inter BEE 2019. In the interview, Wakamatsu addresses a number of features that have already been confirmed to be on the horizon, such as in-camera CinemaDNG playback and still photo modes while recording video, but he also confirmed a future firmware update will include a LOG picture profile in MOV mode and Raw recording over HDMI.The LOG picture profile should improve the dynamic range of the fp and offer more flexibility in post-production, while Raw recording over HDMI would allow external recorders, such as the popular Atomos Ninja V, to record ProRes RAW footage.No specific timeframe is given for the firmware updates, but Cinema5D notes the updates will arrive in 2020 and be free of charge. Our previous coverage of the Sigma fp includes a look inside the Aizu factory where it’s assembled, a video-centric hands-on and a photo gallery of images captured with the world’s smallest full-frame camera.I wonder what the log profile will be called? Sony already has their name on S-log. SG-log?It looks, like Sigma ignores Nikon Z. I wish them well and understand it, ... But I love to see 16mm f1.4 for Nikon ASAP...They won't be ignoring anything.They are a lens manufacturer more so than they are a camera manufacturer.Sigma waits up to the moment the time is right for them to invest.Developing lenses costs money. That money can only come back if a system is sustainable enough.Little use investing in a failing system. At this point Nikon should plead to Sigma/Tamron to develop lenses for them and support them in doing so. Unfortunately, arrogance will be Nikon's downfall.I think the OP means the price.  For the same price we can get Z6 with everything except real Z lenses, this little guy needs to pay for each the components that adds on, such as the grip, the hotshoe and etc... Without comparing lenses in the equation, I think this FP + components will cost like Z7, heavier than Z, bigger than Z, external Log like Z, when features may only par with Z6 and not 45MP.AND! he said the firmware update takes long time.   lolIt is far from a failing system.Z6 is actually selling pretty well in our store and we sell nearly as many as we sell Sony A7 series.Considering that Nikon won't license the mount specifications, I'm not all that shocked.I dont think they will do any lens for Z System due extremely poor sales. Its worrying time for Nikon as Sigma is distancing itself from risky Z Platform.What a fun little camera.The more I read about it, the more I like it.
