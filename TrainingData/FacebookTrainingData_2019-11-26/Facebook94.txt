It is unclear whether there are any more to follow.The eight men with whom Mr Zuckerberg was filmed in conversation were Harvard law professors Jonathan Zittrain and Noah Feldman, Mathias Dopfner, CEO of publisher Axel Springer, Dr Joe DeRisi and Dr Steve Quake who run the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, economist Tyler Cowen, Patrick Collison, CEO of payment platform Stripe and historian Yuval Noah Harari.The only woman to take part was Jenny Martinez, dean of Stanford law school.In terms of their ages, eight of the nine contributors were either in their 40s or 50s. Mr Collison was the youngest, aged 31.Journalist Kurt Wagner, who covered the story for Bloomberg, also noted that seven of the nine were either professors or doctors."Not exactly branching out," he tweeted.The topics discussed in the videos included health research, governance issues, artificial intelligence, privacy and the fight against fake news.Mr Zuckerberg famously sets himself a challenge every year. In the past these have included learning Mandarin, visiting every US state and running 365 miles.Jeremy Corbyn urges Jewish community to "engage" with him following the chief rabbi's outspoken criticism.Insider gossip direct from the diva herselfSign up for our newsletter
