They're tied for the best record in the NFC East, but with games against the Patriots and Seahawks over the next two weeks, they have little margin for error.Record: 5-4Last week: 15thWeek 10 result: Lost to the Vikings, 28-24Week 11 opponent: at Detroit LionsOne thing to know: Ezekiel Elliott was stifled on Sunday against the Vikings, taking 20 carries for just 47 yards.

Once again, Adam Vinatieri deserves some blame, as he missed another crucial extra-point in this one.

He now leads the league in TDs.  Record: 8-1Last week: 5thWeek 10 result: ByeWeek 11 opponent: at Philadelphia EaglesOne thing to know: After something of a cupcake schedule to start the season, the Patriots face a much more formidable stretch coming out of their bye week, with games at Philadelphia, vs. Dallas, and at Houston next on the slate. While most teams might worry about such a tough three-game stretch, with a two-game lead on the division, the Patriots have little to fret.Record: 8-1Last week: 1stWeek 10 result: Lost to the Seahawks, 27-24Week 11 opponent: vs. Arizona CardinalsOne thing to know: Should the 49ers feel positive that they had the chance to beat the Seahawks despite a poor game from Jimmy Garoppolo or nervous that he couldn't deliver for them down the stretch? Garoppolo's turnovers and near-turnovers are alarming — he had a pick and two lost fumbles in Week 10 and nearly threw several other interceptions.Record: 8-2Last week: 3rdWeek 10 result: Beat the 49ers, 27-24Week 11 opponent: ByeOne thing to know: After Lamar Jackson made his case for NFL MVP on Sunday, Russell Wilson played an masterful game on Monday night to remind the football world why he is the current favorite to win the award.Record: 7-2Last week: 4thWeek 10 result: Beat the Bengals, 49-13Week 11 opponent: vs. Houston TexansOne thing to know: Lamar Jackson continued his case for MVP with an incredible, spinning, 47-yard touchdown run. In Jackson's first 16 starts, he has a better passer rating than Tom Brady did, a better completion percentage than Drew Brees did, and more wins than Patrick Mahomes did. Not bad for a running back.
