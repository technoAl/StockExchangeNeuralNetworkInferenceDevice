Noe moved from Paris to the “super boring” French countryside in his youth where he spent all day on his bicycle inventing new worlds in his mind. After a brief attempt at becoming a movie star, he found design. He came home from a trip to Morocco with both a baby, and a job designing a high profile restaurant (not with the same people). Now based in Lisbon, he’s designing for global brands and fixing problems through emotions and moments of sincerity.
