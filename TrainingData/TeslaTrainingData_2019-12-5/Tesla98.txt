Kevin Lee's head kick was so powerful that it left his opponent stiff, unconscious, and on the floor at UFC 244 on Saturday. And the knockout was so nasty that the UFC rewarded Lee with a $50,000 bonus, MMA Junkie reported.It was a massive turnaround in fortunes for the 27-year-old American. Lee had been written off after back-to-back losses to Al Iaquinta and Rafael dos Anjos in the past year but produced a highlight-reel knockout by defeating Gregor Gillespie in style on Saturday.It all happened midway through the first round of their lightweight fight at Madison Square Garden in New York City.Lee staggered Gillespie with a thudding overhand right, then followed up with a left-footed head kick that separated his opponent from his senses as soon as it landed on his chin.Gillespie was unconscious before he hit the canvas, but Lee hit him with afters anyway, sending a right-handed hammer fist down on the beaten New Yorker's face before the referee tackled Lee to protect Gillespie.Watch it here:Or here if you're in a different region:"When you come out and do what Kevin Lee did tonight — people are talking about Kevin Lee," the UFC boss Dana White said in a media scrum.
