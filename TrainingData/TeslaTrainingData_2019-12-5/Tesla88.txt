You can find lingering discounts at Google, Apple, Amazon and Target likely through the end of Cyber Week.Many of Target's Cyber Week deals have the same listed prices as Cyber Monday, with the absence of an additional perk like 15% off at checkout. As always, RedCard holders will save an extra 5% on their purchase, and when you choose same-day delivery from Shipt today you'll earn $20 when you spend $100. Subscribe to our newsletter.
