(Sorry, UK readers.) We're also not sure whether or not the discount applies to Disney+'s Hulu and ESPN+ bundle (normally $12.99/month), but it's worth a shot, especially if you haven't signed up just yet.Head over the Disney+ website at some point before midnight on Dec. 2 to take advantage of this Cyber Monday discount and snag an annual subscription for only $59.99.
