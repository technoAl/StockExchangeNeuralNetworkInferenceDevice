Trying to sell a house in a weak market can lead to disappointment and price cuts. However, there are certain factors that owners can analyze to determine whether or not they're entering the market at a good time.

Of the top 15 housing markets that made the list, six of them are located in Florida.To gather the list, GoBankingRates looked at cities where home values are greater than median list prices and analyzed each market across six weighted factors using figures from Zillow's 2019 Housing Data: the average median list price, the difference between the average home value and the average median list price, the average number of houses that hit the market, the average number of days those houses spend on the real-estate listing platform Zillow, the percentage of listings with price cuts, and the median percentage of the price cuts.The data in this study represents each market as of November 5, 2019.
