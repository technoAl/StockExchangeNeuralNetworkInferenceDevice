(Update: Expired.)They sure look like AirPods Pro, but they cost a lot lot lot less.Read More: Best AirPod Pro alternatives that cost lessMeanwhile, here's a quickie non-coupon deal that should be on your radar today: The hottest gift item of 2019, the Nintendo Switch Lite, is currently just $124 from eBay seller Antonline. This will not last long, so apologies if it's sold out by the time you see it. Update: Aaargh... the price jumped to $179 mere minutes after I posted this. Still a deal, just not nearly as good. Update No. 2: Woot has the Switch Lite for $190 in all three colors, and the price drops to $180 at checkout for Amazon Prime subscribers Speaking of hot gift items, I don't think there's a hotter category right now than true-wireless earbuds. Or a bigger category: At last count, there were some 37 million products. (I may be exaggerating. It's probably closer to 36 million.)But how much do you really need to pay for a decent-sounding set of AirPods Pro-like earbuds? Turns out, not much: For a limited time, and while supplies last, Amazon seller BesDio has the TaoTronics SoundLiberty 53 for $29.99. That's after clipping the $12-off coupon on the product page and then applying promo code YYWNL053 at checkout.The SoundLiberty 53 is a dead ringer for last year's TaoTronics TT-BH053, which CNET's David Carnoy ranked among "the better sub-$50 true-wireless earphones." In fact, from what I can tell from the specs, the only real difference is a slightly improved IPX waterproof rating: IPX7 versus IPX6 on the 2018 model.Everything else appears to be the same: "Pipe" design, battery life (5 hours, with the promise of 7 full recharges from the compact charging case), Bluetooth 5.0 and so on.As noted, these look a lot like AirPods Pro, complete with noise-isolating ear tips. Of course, the SoundLiberty 53s don't offer active noise cancellation (ANC), but with a good fit inside your ear canal, they'll block a good amount of outside sound.In some respects, these are a bit behind the times. The charging case uses micro-USB, not USB-C, and doesn't support wireless charging.But, jeez, $30. Not $50, not $100, and definitely not $250. If you're curious about true-wireless earbuds or need an affordable gift for someone, definitely check these out.Your thoughts?CNET's Cheapskate scours the web for great deals on tech products and much more.
