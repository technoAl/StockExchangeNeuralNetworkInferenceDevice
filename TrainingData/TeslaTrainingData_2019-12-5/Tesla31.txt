These are phones that come with Alexa pre-installed right out of the box, meaning you'll be able to summon Alexa for all of your daily inquiries and smart home commands. These are especially great phones for anyone who already owns and loves other Amazon Echo products powered by Alexa, and loves the idea of seamless Alexa integration in a smartphone.The Moto G7 is a mid-range phone with a sleek glass design, giving it a nice premium feel despite the steeply discounted sticker price.
