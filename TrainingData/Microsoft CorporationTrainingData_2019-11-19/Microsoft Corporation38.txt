While some people are scrambling to secure a partner to show off to their families by Thanksgiving, others may be looking to avoid their spouses entirely and maybe find an affair. Ashley Madison, a dating site designed to help people have affairs, released a list of the 20 most unfaithful cities in the US for cuffing season. The rankings are based on the number of people who created Ashley Madison accounts per capita for each city. Though New Jersey cities hold first and second place, California was a strong contender and had the highest number of unfaithful cities on the list overall.
