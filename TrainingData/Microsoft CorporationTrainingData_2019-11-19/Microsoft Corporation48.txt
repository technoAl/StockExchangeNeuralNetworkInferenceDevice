Their findings, published in October 2019, show that both male and female nurses had higher rates of suicide than men and women respectively in the US.The study found that the suicide incidence rate for female nurses was about 58% higher than the general female population, and the rate for male nurses was about 41% higher than among the general male population.For nurses, hardships on the job include long hours because of nationwide worker shortages, along with dealing with physical and verbal abuse at work.According to the National Restaurant Association, restaurants in the US make up an $863 billion dollar industry with 15.3 million employees.Katy McLaughlin and Natalia V.
