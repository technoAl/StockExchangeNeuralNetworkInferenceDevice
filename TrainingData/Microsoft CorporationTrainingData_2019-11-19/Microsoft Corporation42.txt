Most of us have heard how similar to humans chimpanzees can act — but it's another thing to see it.A photo of chimps reaching out to the camera for help has been judged as one of the most striking nature photos of the year, according to the Nature Photographer of the Year 2019 competition.Presented by Dutch organization Nature Talks, the competition showcases the beauty of the natural world and the importance of conservation.Seven judges sifted through about 14,000 images (a new record for the competition) from photographers in 73 different countries to award prizes across 11 categories. The Nature Photographer of the Year prize went to Csaba Daróczi of Hungary, who snapped a perfectly-timed (and illuminated) shot of a pair of rabbits leaping high into the air."This photo is proof of the fact that you don't have to get extremely rare or extraordinary species in front of your camera to be able to create a great nature photo," said Keith Wilson, chair of the jury. "If you have a vision and a creative mind you can create a great shot close to home."Here are a few of the best shots from the competition.Read more:A cat named Quilty has become internet famous after he was placed in solitary confinement for helping other cats escape at a Texas shelterMeet 'Narwhal the Little Magical Furry Unicorn,' a rescue puppy born with an extra tail on his face19 hysterical winners from this year's Comedy Wildlife Photography AwardsAn awkwardly timed photo of an adorable lion cub is the funniest animal photo of 2019Wild turkeys are terrorizing the town of Tom's River, New Jersey, by pecking at roofs, breaking windows, and attacking residentsLike what you see here?
