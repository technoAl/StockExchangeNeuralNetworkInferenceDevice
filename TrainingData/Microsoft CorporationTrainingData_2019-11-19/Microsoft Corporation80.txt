Virginia Tech takes down Michigan State basketball in MauiVT's Nolley breaks down his dagger 3DII women's volleyball bracket releasedFour of men's college basketball's elite programs tipped off the 2019 season on Tuesday night in the annual Champions Classic. No. 4 Duke outlasted No. 3 Kansas 68-66 in the first game, and No. 2 Kentucky beat No. 1 Michigan State 67-62 in the following clash.This year's Classic was played at Madison Square Garden in New York City, and featured the top 4 teams in the preseason AP Poll. Here were the final scores and stats:The No. 4 Duke Blue Devils defeated the third-ranked Kansas Jayhawks 68-66 in the first game of the 2019 Champions Classic at Madison Square Garden. In a contest that featured 42 combined turnovers, Duke found just enough offense to hang on for the win.Devon Dotson led all scorers with 17 points on 5-of-9 shooting. But his six turnovers were a microcosm of how the night unfolded for his Jayhawks. Kansas committed 26 in total and 18 in the first half alone. Duke wasn't perfect either. The Blue Devils had 16 turnovers of their own. But this game eventually came down to which team executed when it mattered most. Tre Jones led Duke with 15 points, six rebounds and six assists. The sophomore guard came up with a key defensive rebound in the closing seconds.The nightcap also lived up to its billing. The top two teams in the country met as No. 1 Michigan State faced No. 2 Kentucky. Like the first game, this one began rather slow. But Cassius Winston and Tyrese Maxey shined from start to finish.Winston was the only Spartan to score in double figures, finishing with 21 points, four assists and two rebounds. Maxey, meanwhile, made quite the impression in his collegiate debut. The freshman posted a game-high 26 points on 7-of-13 shooting. He also added five rebounds and two assists.Kentucky survived every Spartans run, and left Madison Square Garden with a 69-62 victory. Both games were mired in sloppy play for long stretches. But that's to be expected for a season opener. Especially with the introduction of an expanded 3-point line. The four teams in the Champions Classic combined to shoot 29.8 percent (23-of-77) from deep on Tuesday night.Kentucky 69 , Michigan State 62 | FinalTyrese Maxey's debut lived up to the hype. Not only did he lead all scorers with 26 points, he sealed off his defender to come away with the rebound on Kyle Ahrens' missed 3-pointer.Kentucky 65, Michigan State 60 | 2nd 0:59Maxey comes through with a clutch triple several feet behind the 3-point line. He leads all scorers with 26 points on the night. Kentucky 62, Michigan State 60 | 2nd 1:27Cassius Winston completes an old-fashioned three-point play with a beautiful Euro-step layup.Kentucky 60, Michigan State 56 | 2nd 3:45Tyrese Maxey blows by Rockets Watts Jr. with a nice hesitation move, and finishes with a layup off the glass. But whenever it appears that Kentucky is about to pull away, the Spartans come back down the floor and respond.Kentucky 54, Michigan State 48 | 2nd 7:57And now it's the Spartans who go on a run of their own, scoring seven straight points to make it a two-possession game. The last five or so minutes of play have been the smoothest of the night in the Champions Classic. Kentucky 54, Michigan State 41 | 2nd 9:57Back-to-back 3-pointers from Kahlil Whitney and Nate Sestina have given the Wildcats their largest lead of the night. Those two triples add to a 9-0 run for Kentucky.Kentucky 48 , Michigan State 41 | 2nd 11:13Winston picks up his third foul as he went to close out on an Immanuel Quickley 3-point attempt. Quickley made all three free throws, and neither team has been able to sustain much of a run. Kentucky 36 , Michigan State 32 | 2nd 16:00The Spartans are moving the ball much better in this second half. They've caught Kentucky out of position and are driving to the basket with more assertiveness. Kentucky 34 , Michigan State 28| 2nd 18:08Michigan State begins the half on a 4-0 run, capped off by a layup in transition by Aaron Henry. Kentucky head coach John Calipari calls timeout. Kentucky 34, Michigan State 24 | HalftimeLike the first game of this year's Champions Classic, this one started off slow. There were 16 personal fouls committed in the first nine minutes of play. But eventually Kentucky and Michigan State began to settle in. It was mainly a battle of guard play between Cassius Winston (12 points) and Tyrese Maxey (11 points). Kentucky 30 , Michigan State 23 | 1st  2:38Something to note is the free-throw disparity in this game. The Wildcats have made 16 trips to the free-throw line, while the Spartans only have six. Michigan State hasn't been as willing to attack the basket compared to Kentucky.Kentucky 16, Michigan State 16 | 1st 9:47Winston has gotten into a rhythm, hitting a step-back 3-pointer and finding a rolling Marcus Bingham Jr. for an alley-oop. Both teams have picked up the pace on offense. Kentucky 13, Michigan State 9 | 1st 11:53Kentucky has since cooled off, and hasn't made a field goal in the last five minutes and counting. But they still maintain a slim lead thanks to two free throws from Hagans.Kentucky 11, Michigan State 4| 1st 16:53Ashton Hagans hits a pull-up jumper in front of Cassius Winston. The Wildcats are rolling early on in the first half.Michigan State 0, Kentucky 0 | 1st 20:00We are underway from Madison Square Garden for the second game of the 2019 Champions Classic.

Duke guard Tre Jones comes up with the rebound, and Kansas is forced to foul him with six seconds to play. Jones makes both free throws to seal the victory. Dotson banks in a 3-pointer at the buzzer.Duke 64, Kansas 63 | 2nd 0:37Jack White comes up with a huge steal underneath the basket. He slid over to deny a wide-open Azubuike on the right block.Duke 56, Kansas 55 | 2nd 5:12Duke forces a shot-clock violation against the Jayhawks. Kansas wanted to go inside Azubuike, but he was immediately doubled after receiving the entry pass. Azubuike tried to kick it back up top Dotson but it was too late.Duke 56, Kansas 52 | 2nd 7:46Both teams have found their footing offensively in the second half, albeit with different styles. The Blue Devils have found success running their half-court offense. Kansas has been at its best while attacking in transition before the defense has a chance to set up.Kansas 47, Duke 47 | 2nd 11:34Kansas seems willing to cede the 3-point line to Duke, almost daring the Blue Devils to shoot. Duke has fired at will from beyond the arc, but are just 6-of-18 on 3-point attempts. Kansas 43, Duke 37 | 2nd 15:42Foul trouble could be a problem for Kansas down the stretch. Azubuike and Dotson each have four fouls, while Marcus Garrett has three. Kansas 43, Duke 37 | 2nd 15:51The Jayhawks use an 11-0 run to pull in front of the Blue Devils. Kansas made some nice plays in transition by pushing the ball against a backpedaling Duke defense. Azubuike also found Agbaji on a sweet backdoor cut.Duke 33, Kansas 30 | 2nd 20:00The second half is underway from Madison Square Garden. Devon Dotson (nine points) and Tre Jones (eight points) lead the Jayhawks and Blue Devils in scoring, respectively.Duke 33, Kansas 30 | HalftimeDespite committing 18 turnovers, the Jayhawks only trail the Blue Devils 33-30. Kansas is shooting 47.6 percent from the floor, while Duke has hit 37.1 percent of their field-goal attempts. Jayhawks point guard Devon Dotson leads all scorers with nine points on 2-of-4 shooting. Dotson's aggressiveness on offense has paid off, as he is 5-of-6 from the free-throw line.Duke 31, Kansas 26 | 1st  2:18Tre Jones has beat multiple Kansas defenders off the dribble tonight. He has caught the Jayhawks' help defense out of position, and has muscled his way inside for several layups. Kansas 22, Duke 20 | 1st 6:05Duke is doubling Azubuike and McCormack whenever they get the ball in the post. Kansas has struggled to find its two post players in the paint. Of course, the 14 turnovers haven't helped the Jayhawks settle in offensively either. Kansas 20, Duke 18 | 1st 7:46The Jayhawks are defending the high pick-and-roll well. Tre Jones and Wendell Moore haven't been able to get much separation off of ball screens, and many of Duke's field-goal attempts have been contested.Kansas 11, Duke 10 | 1st 13:19Azubuike commits another travel and heads to the bench. He has three turnovers already.Duke 10 , Kansas 9 | 1st 14:20Some sloppy play from both teams early on. Udoka Azubuike picked up a travel on an entry pass with an open lane in front of him.Duke 10, Kansas 9 | 1st 15:38Duke's Matthew Hurt leads all scorers with five points on 2-of-3 shooting.
