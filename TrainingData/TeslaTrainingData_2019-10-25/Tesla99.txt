The 106-year-old Woolworth Building is one of New York City's most historic and iconic towers.The 792-foot tower was the tallest building in the world for 17 years, from its completion in 1913 until 1930, at which point the Chrysler Building overtook it.Originally developed by the F.W. Woolworth Company as an office building, the Woolworth Building was nicknamed the "Cathedral of Commerce" and housed tenants such as Nikola Tesla and the Manhattan Project.Today, while the lower 28 floors remain offices, Alchemy Properties now owns floors 29 and up and transformed them into 32 luxury residences over the course of a five-year, multimillion-dollar renovation. The restoration work on the exterior alone cost $22 million.We got inside the building for a tour of one of these residences: Pavilion A, a $29.85 million condo that's the most expensive unit currently listed in the building. When the building's 9,680-square-foot penthouse is finished, Pavilion A will be the second-most expensive condo in the building. Joshua Judge, Stan Ponte, and Tate Kelly of Sotheby's International Realty hold the listing.Take a look inside the Woolworth's Building Pavilion A, which spans 6,711 interior square feet and comes with two terraces.The downtown Manhattan skyscraper was built for $13.5 million by the F.W. Woolworth Company, a retail company started by Frank Winfield Woolworth that launched the five-and-dime store concept.Some of the Woolworth Building's residences were already put on the market before they had floor plans and before anyone could see them.In 2017, the building's 9,680-square-foot penthouse, Pinnacle, hit the market for $110 million.As of October 2019, eight residences are listed for sale, starting at $2.85 million and going up to $29.85 million.The Woolworth Building's main entrance — for the office floors — is on Broadway across from City Hall Park.The lobby is staffed by a 24-hour doorman and a full-time concierge.The entryway of the holds a sitting area and leads into a bedroom that's currently set up as a study.The great room is about 52 feet long and boasts 22-foot ceilings, which were partially made possible by Alchemy adding about six feet to the top of the unit.Source: StreetEasyThe three-bedroom residence shares the 29th floor with Pavilion A. Even though it's not technically a penthouse, the residence is able to have skylights because it's located in the first setback of the building."[Pavilion A] is for someone who appreciates legacy, history, and quality that will ensure the test of time," Judge said.Right before our tour of Pavilion A, Judge had showed one of the residences to a local family with a baby who wanted more space for their family.The history of the Woolworth Building puts it in stark contrast to the brand-new, super-tall and skinny skyscrapers rising on Billionaires' Row.While the Woolworth Building's residences have been selling mainly to New Yorkers who actually want to live in them, the condos on Billionaires' Row are often picked up by international or out-of-state millionaires and billionaires who may rarely even live in them.
