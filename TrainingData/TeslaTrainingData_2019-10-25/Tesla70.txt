The EV plant will build powertrains, batteries, and vehicles, starting with the company's upcoming Model Y compact crossover utility vehicle. The location will also build its mid-range Model 3 sedan and is expected to begin production by 2021, per Tesla's Q3 2019 Update. Here's why Germany is the logical choice for Tesla's EV production: Competition in Europe was already fierce, but now automakers are being put on alert as they face Tesla, which is arguably the face of the EV movement. Sales of chargeable vehicles in the region increased 52% year-over-year from Q3 2018 to Q3 2019 to reach 110,630, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.With nearly every major automaker in the region making moves to capture a piece of this growing market, share will become harder to come by. And competition will heat up further now that Tesla, often considered the global EV leader, has decided to set up local operations of its own.There are a number of avenues European automakers can take to hold off Tesla. Perhaps the easiest would be to join forces with each other to share technology and resources, enabling them to bring best-in-class products to market. Another avenue, though riskier, is to push up EV timelines to beat Tesla to market. If automakers can avoid manufacturing blunders and hold the amount of debt needed to move up timelines, they would be in line for larger gains from an early mover advantage. Regardless of what European automakers do, they need to start building out a Tesla strategy now. Want to read more stories like this one? Here's how to get access:
