Hyundai has revealed two concept vehicles at the North American Commercial Vehicle (NACV) Show as a part of its Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle 2030 Vision.The automaker introduced the HDC-6 NEPTUNE Concept Class 8 heavy-duty truck, while Hyundai Translead, its trailer manufacturer, announced  HT Nitro ThermoTech that was developed with Air Liquide. Combined, they make an environmentally-friendly semi-trailer truck.Fuel cells are the "perfect fit" for commercial heavy-duty trucks because of a higher drive range and payload and lessened refueling time and costs, according to the automaker."The tractor-trailer combination provides a window into the future of the transportation in the U.S. and around the world," the automaker said in a prepared statement.The automaker's 2030 Vision includes the widespread use of hydrogen-powered fuel cell technology in order to its goal of producing zero-emission vehicles in a decarbonized world. The trailer was created specifically in response to the need to reduce greenhouse gases and fossil fuel dependency.In December 2018, the automaker invested $6.4 billion into the development of hydrogen technology in different types of vehicles.This is the first time the two concepts have been shown in the US commercial vehicle market, which the automaker says it will begin exploring. It's also opening its doors to potential partners who want to join them in creating a hydrogen "ecosystem" for commercial vehicles.The automaker will be bringing 1,600 FCEV heavy-duty trucks to the Swiss commercial vehicle market from 2019 to 2023.Keep scrolling to see Hyundai's concept commercial semi, which could rival that of Tesla's: "The Hyundai Commercial Vehicles Design Team started with a white sheet of paper focusing on the new defined functionality resetting all standards in order to project commercial vehicles in the future," he continued.The roof and side and front walls are one piece and made with fiber-reinforced polymer skins. This makes the trailer lighter in weight while increasing its wall strength and thermal capabilities.It's also silent, making it good for neighborhood nighttime deliveries, according to the automaker.
