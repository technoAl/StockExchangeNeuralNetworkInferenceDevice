Ahead of Stadia’s launch next week, Google’s representatives fielded questions during an AMA on Reddit about what exactly the video game streaming service will include in the beginning. The answer is, not much.The whole thread was a good reminder that much of Stadia remains as theoretical as it seemed when it was originally pitched during its reveal at Google’s GDC 2019 press conference. Also, a lot of its features are slated to arrive sometime next year, rather than on November 19 when the service goes live. Here’s a quick rundown of everything that won’t be available initially:We also learned earlier this week that the service will only support 12 games at launch. Though they include some great ones, like Red Dead Redemption II and Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, with 14 more expected by the end of the year including Borderlands 3, we still don’t know which games will come to the service after that, or when. And remember, all of these games need to be purchased separately, in addition to Stadia’s $10 monthly Stadia Pro subscription cost. (The free, stripped down version of Stadia won’t be available until next year.)“Our approach to releasing features on Stadia is similar to how we run Google Search, YouTube and other Google services: gradual rollout and continuous improvement, based on your feedback,” Doronichev said. “We always start with nailing the key user-journey and then proceed with releasing extra features. YouTube started with ‘watch video.’ For Stadia it’s ‘Play the Game on your biggest screen.”Kotaku staff writer. You can reach him at ethan.gach@kotaku.com
