The 747 is one of the longest-serving aircraft in commercial aviation. It first served in 1970, and became a passenger favorite. Some are still in service, though airlines are gradually phasing them out. Boeing earlier this year unveiled the 777X, which will replace not only the 747, but 777s currently in service as long haul aircraft around the world."The big airplane of the future for the aviation industry is going to be the Boeing 777-9," Randy Tinseth, Boeing's vice president of marketing, told Business Insider in an interview at the Farnborough Air Show last year. El Al has plans to replace its 747s with a fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners, according to the Jerusalem Post. It has already taken delivery of 12 of the aircraft, the Jerusalem Post added.Get the latest Boeing stock price here.
