Devastating photos give a small insight into the impact of catastrophic bushfires currently raging across Australia's eastern state of New South Wales.On Monday, a state of emergency was declared for the state, with high temperatures, strong winds and low humidity contributing to a "catastrophic fire danger" forecast for the Greater Sydney, Greater Hunter and Illawarra Shoalhaven areas. Officials report three people killed, at least 150 homes destroyed, and thousands forced to evacuate.As of Tuesday, there have been over 300 new fires across the state, with 70 still burning and half of these not yet controlled. According to the NSW Rural Fire Service, five fires are still at emergency alert level.AFP reports that experts have described the conditions as the worst ever recorded. Across the state of NSW, which has long experienced extreme drought conditions, winds have hit speeds of 80 kilometres (50 miles) per hour, while temperatures have reached up to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) — a deadly combination.Nearer to the state capital of Sydney, bushfires have reached 17 kilometres of the city centre, with streets, homes, and cars in suburbs like South Turramurra covered in bright pink flame retardant. According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's current affairs program 7:30, the fires across northern NSW have so far burned more than 850,000 hectares— that's almost double that of the Black Saturday bushfires across Victoria in 2009. The program analysed fire warning data between 1973 and 2010, and found that bushfire conditions have indeed gotten worse in these areas across Australia.Here are a collection of photos that illustrate a small portion of the impact of these catastrophic bushfires, although the lasting effects can't really be captured in one frame.
