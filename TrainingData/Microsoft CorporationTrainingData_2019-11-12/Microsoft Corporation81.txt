Student journalists at Northwestern University sparked a backlash from professional journalists across the country after publishing a November 10 editorial apologizing for what appeared to be basic newsgathering practices.The controversy began when the student newspaper, The Daily Northwestern, covered on-campus protests against a visit by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Not long after, the newspaper published an editorial apologizing for some of its reporting methods, which it said "hurt students."Among the offenses listed were posting photographs of the protest on Twitter, and using the campus directory to look up phone numbers of students who attended the events."Some protesters found photos posted to reporters' Twitter accounts retraumatizing and invasive. Those photos have since been taken down," the editorial said. It also described the interview requests as "an invasion of privacy" and said staff members have since learned "the correct way to reach out to students for stories."The techniques the editorial described are standard procedures for reporters, who regularly use public directories to contact potential sources, and who are frequently tasked with photographing and writing about public events.But The Daily Northwestern's editorial apologized for the way it went about its coverage, noting that some students had "voiced concerns.""Ultimately, The Daily failed to consider our impact in our reporting surrounding Jeff Sessions," the editorial said. "We know we hurt students that night, especially those who identify with marginalized groups."On Monday, journalists across the country weighed in on the editorial on Twitter. Some of them lambasted the episode as examples of political correctness or victim mentality run amok.Many journalists noted that the reporting techniques mentioned in the editorial are considered crucial newsgathering methods, chiding the newspaper for apologizing for them. A number of journalists also defended the students, arguing the controversy was overblown and that it was unfair for prominent, professional journalists to publicly pile on to young students. Some also said the student journalists deserved empathy and understanding for trying to build trust with marginalized campus groups and listen to their concerns.On Monday evening, the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Troy Closson, responded to the criticisms in a Twitter thread, explaining that the publication stood by its reporting on the Sessions protests but acknowledging that the editorial "over-corrected" in certain aspects.Closson mentioned that he was only the third black editor-in-chief to helm The Daily Northwestern and that the role came with a unique pressure."Being in this role and balancing our coverage and the role of this paper on campus with my racial identity — and knowing how our paper has historically failed students of color, and particularly black students, has been incredibly challenging to navigate," he wrote.He continued: "We aren't unclear about our rights as a newspaper to cover student protest, but also understand the need to do so with empathy."On Tuesday, the dean of Northwestern University's journalism school weighed in on the controversy, releasing a statement that vehemently defended the newspaper's reporting."Like those student journalists, I, too, have been approached by several student activists who were angered by the fact that they and their peers were depicted on the various platforms of The Daily engaged in the very public act of protesting the Sessions speech," Dean Charles Whitaker wrote. "I have explained to those activists that as Northwestern's — and the city of Evanston's — principal paper of record, The Daily had an obligation to capture the event, both for the benefit of its current audience as well as for posterity."He continued: "I have also offered that it is naïve, not to mention wrong-headed, to declare, as many of our student activists have, that The Daily staff and other student journalists had somehow violated the personal space of the protestors by reporting on the proceedings, which were conducted in the open and were designed, ostensibly, to garner attention."Whitaker said it's true that irresponsible or unfair journalism can traumatize its subjects — but that was not what The Daily Northwestern students did.He went on to say that the student journalists' actions were "the kind of industrious reporting and information-gathering that we expect from enterprising reporters." He added that they did not invade privacy or trespass or steal documents, but rather they sought to simply ask questions and take photos."As the dean of Medill, where many of these young journalists are trained, I am deeply troubled by the vicious bullying and badgering that the students responsible for that coverage have endured for the "sin" of doing journalism," Whitaker wrote.

The Northwestern controversy follows a similar episode involving Harvard's student newspaper, The Harvard Crimson, and backlash from the student body over its reporting practices.On-campus groups took issue with the publication for reaching out to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency spokesperson for comment regarding an "Abolish ICE" protest in September. Reaching out to government agencies for comment on articles involving criticism or allegations of wrongdoing is standard practice for journalists.In the Crimson's case, the newspaper's president, Kristine Guillaume, reiterated the publication's policy of treating all subjects in a story fairly by requesting comment."Fundamental journalistic values obligate The Crimson to allow all subjects of a story a chance to comment," Guillaume wrote in a statement. "This policy demonstrates a commitment to ensuring that the individuals and institutions we write about have an opportunity to respond to criticisms in order to ensure a fair and unbiased story."Like what you see here?
