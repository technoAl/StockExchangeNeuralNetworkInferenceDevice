Indian conglomerate Tata Group approached German automaker BMW and Chinese auto giant Geely seeking to split electric vehicle (EV) development costs for its luxury brand Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), according to Bloomberg. However, Tata's effort to find an EV development partner for JLR is in early stages and is not limited to Geely and BMW, per unnamed sources cited by Bloomberg.

Here's why the two auto brands would be attractive partners for JLR: Auto brands with less robust R&D resources, like JLR, need to partner with larger companies to efficiently develop and manufacture EVs, since they won't see quick returns on their investments. Larger automakers have committed billions to develop EVs and have large-scale R&D infrastructure to support their efforts: BMW plans to spend at least $6.5 billion on EV development over the next five to 10 years, while Tata has committed $900 million, for instance. But EV sales are relatively low, representing around 3% of the 84 million vehicles sold worldwide in 2018.While EVs as a share of global auto sales are expected to increase to 15% by 2024, smaller automakers will have to compete with the same pool of traditional rivals as well as newer EV challengers, like Tesla, for a slice of a relatively small pie. The level of competition and small market size will likely lead smaller automakers to initially struggle to see quick returns on their EV investments. Larger automakers making early strides in EV development, like BMW, can take advantage of this need by leveraging their advanced position to build out partnerships and more quickly recoup their investment in EVs. EV manufacturing requires ground-up vehicle redesigns, new supply chains, and retooled production facilities, lending itself to larger automakers that have the manpower and resources to make changes without major interruptions to their legacy products.Larger automakers can leverage this advantage by forming early agreements and relationships with smaller automakers, sharing in EV development costs and even licensing their existing EV tech to partners. For instance, Volkswagen licensed its modular EV platform to Ford in July 2019 and is in talks to sell its premium EV platform to smaller luxury automakers.Want to read more stories like this one?
