Having a job that you find engaging and meaningful has benefits in and out of the workplace.If he were to give his 25-year-old self advice, Christophe Georges, the CEO of Bentley Motors Inc. — Bentley's Americas division — would say to focus on finding a job he enjoyed."Coming from France, I would have never expected to be CEO of Bentley in America. How can you plan for it?" Georges said in an interview with Business Insider. "You just need to do what you like to do and be passionate about it, and opportunities just come."Georges attributed the 21 years he's worked at Bentley to the passion he has for his work. He's told his oldest child, who's in college, to focus on finding satisfying work, rather than trying to conform to other people's expectations.Studies have shown that those who find meaning and satisfaction in their work tend to feel better about their jobs and their lives, but a 2017 Gallup survey found that fewer than 40% of Americans working in 10 different industries or job functions were engaged in their work.Jane Dutton, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, told the American Psychological Association that workers can increase job satisfaction by using more energy on the tasks they enjoy, making positive social connections in the workplace, and framing their jobs in ways that make them seem more meaningful.
