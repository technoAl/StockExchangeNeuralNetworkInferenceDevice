Her "Friends" costar and close friend Jennifer Aniston commented: "You're hilarious. Oh my GOD I love you," along with a string of laughing emojis.  The post was in response to a selfie comedian David Spade uploaded on Thursday of him and Cox along with The Bachelor star Nick Viall.While Spade hinted at a new project in the works for the trio — a new late-night show called "Lights Out" — his followers seemed to be more interested in Cox's resemblance to Jenner.
