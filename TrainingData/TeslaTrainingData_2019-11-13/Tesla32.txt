 Elon Musk and YouTube personality Casey Neistat shared a moment online as both appreciated a very long telescopic pole employed by a Tesla engineer to assess Neistat's house for solar panels.Neistat shared a photo of the Tesla staffer at his house, with what he described as "the most boss selfie stick I've ever seen."He appeared to be using the stick to work out the practicalities of getting Tesla solar panels onto Neistat's home. Tesla Energy makes both panels and batteries to store the energy.On noticing Neistat's appreciative post, Musk shared it with his own followers, noting: "Innovation comes in many ways."Neistat retweeted that to his followers, and the cycle was complete.The YouTuber has a history of appreciating Musk and his products, though the two appear never to have met.In October 2018, Neistat responded to a tweet by Musk thanking Tesla owners, saying that his Tesla is the "greatest car I've owned."He has also devoted several videos to Musk. One was a riff on Musk's comments linking social media to unhappiness in his infamous weed-smoking interview with Joe Rogan.Another was a tour of a prototype tunnel by Musk's Boring Company in Los Angeles, where Neistat was one of a select group invited on a test drive, though he was not allowed to film it.This is likely not the end of their online bromance.
