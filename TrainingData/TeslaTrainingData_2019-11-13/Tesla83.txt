What's more, the Owl has a max of 15,000 rpm. For the battery, a centrally-mounted lithium-ion battery holds onto a total power of 1300 kW.Urrrgh, they want to impress with numbers but they don't actually understand them.If the battery can output 1300kW, then it can only output 1743HP regardless of what the motors can do. Exactly the same as an electric car with a battery that can pump out eleventy-bajillion HP paired with a 5HP motor can produce a total 5HP. It would need to be able to pump out 1500KW to break 2000HP."But, but, but..." someone will undoubtedly say, "He probably meant KWh!" and if he did, then the entire vehicle and the trailer it tows must be made 100% of batteries, nor do I believe you can charge 1300KWh battery in 80 minutes on a 44KW charger. Could charge a 58KWh battery in 80 minutes with a 44KW charger.Which makes it less output than the Lotus Evija at 1973 HP.puffy999: Other articlesI am seeing say 64 kWh. I keep seeing 1485 kW, but for some reason the HP varies between just over that of the Lotus to just over 2000.The numbers seem to vary depending on the source, but the 1,300 kWh number seems to be low.orbister: puffy999: Other articlesI am seeing say 64 kWh.
