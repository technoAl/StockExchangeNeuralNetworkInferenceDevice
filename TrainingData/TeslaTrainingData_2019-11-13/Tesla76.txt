0 to 62 mph 2.7 seconds
0-to-124 mph 7.1 seconds. (0 – 200 KPH)
1,092 pound-feet / 4,671 pound-feet of torque
Top speed 195 mph (313 KPH)
Battery packs 777V
Range per charge 265 miles
PEAK POWER: 1 MegawattThe hope is that the tech in the EP9 eventually makes it down market to the consumer cars offered NIO, such as the ES6, ES8 and the ET Sedan.The company has wracked up $5 billion in losses over the past 4 years — a feat that took Tesla 15 years. To be fair, these are mostly R&D expenses, and a huge learning curve in the development of how to create a manufacturing process to produce all electric cars. The stock of the Shanghai-based manufacturer has tumbled 90% in 2019.
