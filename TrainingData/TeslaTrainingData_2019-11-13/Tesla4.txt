Elon Musk hinted that he will look into creating a feature for Tesla vehicles with dash cams that would see them automatically record footage when the horn is pressed, telling a Twitter user that such a feature "makes sense." "Yeah, makes sense," Musk replied to Twitter user Brandon Bernicky, who asked his "thoughts on saving dashcam footage when honking the horn?"The dash cam feature is only available in Model S and Model X models manufactured after August 2017, according to Tesla.In these models, as long as they have Tesla's Version 9.0 software, footage from the dash cam can be saved to a USB-stick by inserting it into a port inside the car, and then by configuring the dash cam to save the footage.Musk has long engaged with fans on Twitter to listen to their suggestions for new Tesla features, saying last week he would look into launching a "drive thru mode" on Teslas after a customer complained that her car "beeped like crazy" every time she went to make her order."Can we get a drive thru mode please? It beeps like crazy every time I'm trying to get my chicken sandwich (; thank you!" the customer asked Musk, to which he replied: "Looking into it."Musk on Tuesday announced Tesla's next Gigafactory will be located near Berlin, Germany.
