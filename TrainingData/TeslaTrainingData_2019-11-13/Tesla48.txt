Nvidia is slowly but steadily preparing the launch of their ampere generation GPUs, allegedly starting March 2020, the first models will be out for data-centers. Geforce 3000 for desktop PCs would appear in June. This is reported by the Chinese website HKEPC, citing Chris Caso, an analyst with Raymond James.Accordingly, Nvidia's in-house GTC (GPU Technology Conference, March 22-26, 2020) will initially feature data center GPUs, such as ampere-based Tesla accelerator cards with a focus on scientific computation and artificial intelligence algorithms. This means around Computex in June 2020 the first consumer variants with Ampere chips would see the light of day. The launch would involve the high-end cards first and slower models.  Pascal was manufactured in the 16nm FinFET Variation, Turing is produced in 12nm FinFET, Ampere is said to be manufactured at Samsung on 7nm - using its Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) method 7nm+. In comparison to Turing, the clock rates could be increased by 200 to 300 MHz. 7nm makes transistors smaller, and that allows for more transistors to be placed on a chip. It is expected that Ampere will offer significantly more Raytracing cores than Turing did.
