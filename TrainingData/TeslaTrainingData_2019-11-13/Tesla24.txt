Company CEO Elon Musk has now confirmed via the secondary Tesla press site (also known as his Twitter page) that Gigafactory 4 will be built in Berlin, with production set to kick off in 2021.The Berlin Gigafactory will be an all-encompassing facility that will build batteries, powertrains and vehicles, with the Model Y set to be first model to roll off the assembly line, which will be followed by the Model 3. At an awards ceremony in Germany, Musk added that the plant will be set up near the Berlin Brandenburg Airport, and will be supported by an engineering and design centre in the city, Reuters reports. Meanwhile, Musk told Auto Express that Germany was preferred to Britain, as the latter was considered “too risky” because of the uncertainty caused by Brexit. Will build batteries, powertrains & vehicles, starting with Model Y— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 12, 2019 The Berlin Gigafactory will be the fourth in the company’s portfolio, with the most recent being Gigafactory 3 that is located in Shanghai. The two remaining Gigafactory facilities are located in the United States, with one being in Buffalo, New York, while the other is found in Storey County, Nevada. However, the US sites do not cover vehicle production, and are instead dedicated to supplying battery packs and solar products. Instead, Tesla’s vehicle production in the US is handled by the Tesla Factory in located in Fremont, California, which makes the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and is being prepared to produce the Model Y.
