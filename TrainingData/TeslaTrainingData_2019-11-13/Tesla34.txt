Elon Musk hinted on Tuesday that he would look into making Tesla vehicles with dashcams automatically record footage when the horn is pressed, tweeting that such a feature "makes sense."A Twitter user with the name Brandon Bernicky asked for Musk's "thoughts on saving dashcam footage when honking the horn," and the Tesla founder replied, "Yeah, makes sense."Tesla says a dashcam feature — which doesn't save footage automatically but can save clips on an external USB drive in one of the car's ports — is available in all Model 3 vehicles and in Model S and Model X cars manufactured after August 2017 that have Tesla's Version 9.0 software.Musk has long engaged with fans on Twitter about their suggestions for new Tesla features. Last week, he said he would look into launching a "drive thru mode" on Teslas after someone complained about their car beeping."Can we get a drive thru mode please? It beeps like crazy every time I'm trying to get my chicken sandwich (; thank you!" the person asked Musk, to which he replied, "Looking into it."Musk also on Tuesday announced that Tesla's next Gigafactory would be near Berlin.
