Billie Eilish defended Rihanna against fan criticism that the "Umbrella" singer was focusing too much on her fashion and makeup lines instead of releasing new music. "I think Rihanna is f---ing murdering it," Eilish said in a new interview with Billboard, adding, "Everyone who is like, 'Stop with the [Fenty] brand and put out more music,' I think, 'Shut the f--- up.'" The "Bad Guy" singer was asked what she admired about Rihanna, and had nothing but adoration for the fashion mogul's dedication to her Fenty brand. "She is doing exactly what she needs to do, and that's fire," Eilish said. "Yeah, we want new Rihanna music, but we also want Rihanna. Only props to her." In recent months, fans of the Barbados-born singer have criticized her for seemingly focusing more on her fashion and makeup lines instead of releasing new music. While Rihanna launched a luxury fashion label and published a visual autobiography this year, in addition to continuing work on her lingerie and makeup lines, fans have been vocal about wanting new music — leaving comments like "We want the album sis" on her posts. The singer seemingly responded to eager fans in an Instagram post from November 13. "To all my friends/family/coworkers who I have yet to get back to in the past months... please forgive me. This year has been quite an overwhelming one, and I'm working on that ish called balance. Brb," Rihanna wrote in the caption.
