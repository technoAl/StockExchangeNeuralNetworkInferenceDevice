Players of "The Sims 4" have been delighted to discover a new addition to the in-game store this week: A Baby Yoda statue that looks just like the internet-famous character from "The Mandalorian."Tweets about the new item, which is listed as a decoration and labeled "The Child Statue," started appearing this week. It seems like the statue came along with a patch released around December 12.The statue is listed as "a lovable replica inspired by the Disney+ live action series The Mandalorian," and since Electronic Arts (EA) owns both the "Sims" franchise and the rights to the Star Wars video games, it makes sense that a crossover would be possible.The official Twitter account for the "Sims" franchise acknowledged the new addition and its viral power in a tweet on Saturday – with a TikTok meme, of course.Some users built shrines with the Baby Yoda statue, too.Unfortunately, it doesn't look like you can do anything with Baby Yoda in the game besides look at him, since he's technically a decoration. But at least you can make entire towns full of giant Baby Yodas now. EA didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.Like what you see here?
