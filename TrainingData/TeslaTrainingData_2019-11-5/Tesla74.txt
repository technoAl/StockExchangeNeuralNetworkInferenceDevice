The Studio3 wireless sound much better than their predecessors, pair to Apple devices as easily as AirPods, and even include active noise cancelation. There may be better options at their regular $350 price tag, but they’re worth a listen at $200, a new all-time low price by a whopping $80.Here’s a bold statement: Beats headphones have gotten better since Apple bought the company.… Sennheiser’s wireless noise-canceling headphones were already a decent, low-cost alternative to some of the best noise-canceling headsets on the market, but with today’s price drop to $79, they’re hard to pass up.

You’ll then see a list of the best economy and business class fares, and you can also drill down on the available inventory with the search tools to only see fares for certain months, or in certain price ranges.The cheapest flight we saw was from JFK to Milan for $459 roundtrip (in a double decker A380!), but as you’d expect from Emirates, there are also lots of options to far-flung destinations in the middle east, Asia, and Africa as well.These fares are available (while supplies last, obviously) until November 12, and most seem to be valid for select travel days between November or December and May. Personally, I suggest finding a cheap flight you want now, and figuring out the rest of your vacation details later.

Dyson’s V-series stick vacs have long been go-to cordless options, but the powerful V10 was arguably the first that could truly, completely replace a corded vacuum, at least for smaller homes. In fact, Dyson stopped developing corded vacuums, because the V10 was that good (and has since been improved upon slightly with the V11).

Yes, it features USB-C, microUSB, and even Lightning inputs.The 18W USB-C PD input will be by far the fastest recharge option, but it’s nice to know that any cord you have lying around will be capable of juicing up the battery pack overnight.That USB-C port is also an 18W output port, which can charge an iPhone from 0% to 50% in 30 minutes with the right cable. You also get two standard USB outputs, one of which features Quick Charge 3.0, all tied to a 20,000mAh battery. The lowkey nicest feature though might be the screen that displays your remaining battery life as an actual percentage, rather than an array of like, three or four dots.A few years ago, Apple started adding USB-C fast charging support to its iPhones (iPhone 8 and…The battery is priced at $50, which isn’t out of line for a USB-C PD battery of this size, but if you clip the $5 coupon and use promo code KINJAK172 at checkout, you can get it for just $35.Update: These were briefly available for $228, but have since risen to $278, which would otherwise still be the best deal Amazon’s ever listed on them.Sony’s WH1000XM3s are probably the best noise canceling over ears money can buy, and Amazon just dropped $120 off their price tag seemingly out of nowhere.

It was only a matter of time, but the company is now turning its sights on legitimate, home theater-quality projectors, and preorders just opened.The new Nebula Cosmos 1080p and Nebula Cosmos Max are fully featured projectors in every sense of the word, featuring sharper, brighter pictures than their portable siblings, while retaining features that made those smaller projectors so appealing, like built-in Android, excellent speakers, and support for screen mirroring.The Cosmos 1080p spits out 900 ANSI lumens (for comparison, the Nebula Capsule II puts out a surprisingly good picture with 200) and a 1080p picture, while the Cosmos Max ups the brightness to 1500 ANSI lumens and the picture quality to 4K, while adding a couple more Dolby Digital Plus internal speakers. But both support HDR10, 100,000:1 contrast ratios, LED bulbs that are rated to last a whopping 30,000 hours, and built-in streaming service apps (in addition to a couple of HDMI ports) via Android 9.Anker’s original Nebula Capsule ushered in a sea change in the nascent portable projector market.…But the most disruptive aspect of the Cosmos projectors are their price points. The 1080p model starts at just $429 for super earlybird backers on Kickstarter, and the 4K edition starts at $999, both of which drastically undercut the obvious competition. We briefly saw the Max model in action at Anker’s unveiling, and even in a room with a fair amount of ambient light, it looked terrific.Since the debut of low-price, portable projectors like Anker’s original Nebula and the can-sized…The Kickstarter is live now, and the projectors are expected to start shipping in March.Contributor and Researcher, Kinja Deals at the InventorySenior Director of Commerce | Send deal submissions to deals@gizmodomedia.comFreelance writer for The Inventory.Commerce Editor at The Inventory.Ana works as a commerce editor, but her dream job would be making her senior Yorkie, Tyrone, Insta famous.
