While the Porsche Taycan and Tesla Model S are constantly being compared to one another, they're actually very different cars. And that is exactly what Top Gear's (quite thorough) comparison, released as a YouTube video on Wednesday, shows. The Taycan Turbo S is quicker (albeit by a fraction of a second), it handles better, and behaves better in corners. The Tesla Model S Performance is comfier, roomier, with a far bigger trunk and frunk, and — despite having fewer screens — offers better entertainment options. In short, the Taycan is a better sports car, because it is a sports car, whereas the Model S is a better family sedan, because that's what it is. And let's not forget the price difference between these two: At $180,000, the top Taycan costs nearly double the price of the top Tesla Model S, which is $99,990.It's worth noting that Tesla's 0-60mph time in the video is 2.68 seconds (against the Taycan's 2.61), which is nearly three tenths of a second slower than Tesla's official figure. I've seen videos showing the Model S accelerate even more quickly, so this might not be the end of speed comparisons between these two vehicles. In the 15-minute video you'll also see the two cars do a quarter-mile drag race, glide over quaint German roads, and reach some quite insane speeds on the legendary Autobahn. If you're an electric car enthusiast or just want to get a detailed look of Porsche's first electric sports car, it's well worth your time.
