"The interesting thing is that they've decided to use the Mustang name with this car, because of course it's the name synonymous with American muscle cars, with big V8s... and yet they are taking the performance aspect of that name and putting it into this electric car," she told BBC News."I really hope this is a game-changer."Earlier this year, Ford announced plans to close six manufacturing plants in Europe by the end of 2020.Stuart Rowley, president of Ford of Europe, said at the time the company's future was "rooted in electrification".Analyst Natalie Sauber, from Arcardis, said infrastructure was still a deterrent for consumers considering buying an electric vehicle."Norway is the country with the highest uptake of electric vehicles, followed by other Scandinavian countries," she told the BBC's WorkLife programme."The UK is coming in at the lower end, similar to Germany and the US."

The original was affordable, sporty and - with a hefty engine under the bonnet - decidedly roarty.The electric Mustang Mach-E certainly won't be loud, but maybe it can make a pretty vocal statement nonetheless.Ford is far from being a leader in the race to produce electric cars, but it's putting its foot down in an effort to catch up.It has even done a deal with Volkswagen to use some of the German giant's heavily funded know-how on future models.The new Mach-E will be leading Ford's electric charge. With a range of at least 260 miles, and plenty of power, the new car will be going up against models from Tesla, Jaguar, Audi and Mercedes. Sally may have driven a full-fat petrol V8, but Ford is hoping her eco-conscious granddaughter can be won over by silent elegance - coupled with a decent turn of speed.
