Greta Thunberg can stand her own ground against Donald Trump's weirdly petty Twitter attacks, but a little public support doesn't hurt.Especially if it's from Michelle Obama.The best-selling author and former first lady tweeted a message of solidarity with the teen activist on Thursday, following a bitchy tweets from the president."Don’t let anyone dim your light," Obama wrote. "Ignore the doubters and know that millions of people are cheering you on."She also praised Thunberg as having "so much to offer us all," and compared her to students she met during a recent trip to Vietnam with Julia Roberts, in which the duo aimed to promote young women's education with the Global Girls Alliance, which is part of The Obama Foundation..@GretaThunberg, don’t let anyone dim your light. Like the girls I’ve met in Vietnam and all over the world, you have so much to offer us all.

"Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!"So ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill! https://t.co/M8ZtS8okzE— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2019SEE ALSO: Stephen Colbert tears down Trump's Twitter attack on Greta ThunbergThunberg shut down the president's highly criticised tweets by once again updating her bio to read: "A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend."Greta's got this — it's the same strategy she used last time Trump targeted the teen on Twitter.
