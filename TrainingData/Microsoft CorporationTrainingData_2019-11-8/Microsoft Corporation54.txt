CNET también está disponible en español.Don't show this againHere's a breakdown of how the saga of the controversial Chinese telecom giant and phone maker has unfolded.Huawei is the world's No. 1 telecom supplier and No. 2 phone manufacturer, but it's a pariah in countries like the US -- to the point that the FBI reportedly set up a sting at CES 2019. Over the course of 2019, there's been an upswing in scrutiny of the Chinese telecom giant, with a number of countries banning the use of its networking equipment. And its phones are virtually invisible in the US despite its massive presence around the world.Setting the tone for how the year has unfolded for Huawei, the US Justice Department unsealed indictments in January that included 23 counts pertaining to theft of intellectual property, obstruction of justice and fraud related to its alleged evasion of US sanctions against Iran.    Huawei has long denied any wrongdoing and continues to maintain its innocence.  Related: Honor 9X could be the last Huawei phone to use AndroidThe core issue with Huawei has been concerns about its coziness with the Chinese government and fears that its equipment could be used to spy on other countries and companies. It's the reason why the US banned companies from using Huawei networking equipment in 2012 and why the company was added to the US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security Entity List in May, following an executive order from President Donald Trump effectively banning Huawei from US communications networks. The US offered a temporary reprieve to companies, allowing them to work with Huawei until August. That reprieve was then extended to November.Learn more: Huawei Mate 30 Pro ditches Google Apps, keeps Android.
