Either Google messed up the camera on the Pixel 4, or Apple made significant strides in the iPhone 11-series camera.Whatever happened over the last year, Google's famed pedigree as the best smartphone camera maker on Earth is now in question.I took both the Pixel 4 and iPhone 11 Pro Max for a camera shoot-out, and I came back surprised when I saw the photos on my computer. Check out the photos taken by the Pixel 4 compared to those taken on the iPhone 11 Pro:Apple's latest iPhone camera has caught up to Google's Pixel camera in a big way. The Pixel 4 may eke out a win here and there in the photos above, but not by much at all. Ultimately, however, it's pretty clear that Apple's iPhone 11 Pro is the overall winner for the best smartphone camera of 2019 and most of 2020 until new phones are announced. Apple's win is largely due to its fantastic regular and zoomed cameras, including the option of an ultra-wide lens. The iPhone 11 Pro is simply a more versatile camera than the Pixel 4, which only includes a regular camera lens and a zoomed lens. And unfortunately, Google's software magic for digital zooming doesn't make up for the missing ultra-wide camera on the Pixel 4. I'd even say that the $700 iPhone 11 would also be a better option for anyone who wants the best camera on a smartphone. You get Apple's latest regular camera as well as an ultra-wide lens, which still gives you a lot of versatility. Get the latest Google stock price here.
