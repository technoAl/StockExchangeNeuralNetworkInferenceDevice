When you enter a date that's formatted with slashes, Excel will recognize it as a date. For example, Excel will automatically choose the date format for a cell that contains 11/11/19. You can set Excel to display dates in a variety of ways, no matter how you type in the data. Here's how to find and change date formats in Excel on a Mac or PC.We're using a spreadsheet that includes dates of hire for employees of a fictitious company, to show different ways to format dates in Excel.1.

Pro tip: Never change the format of a cell with a date to General or Text. Excel will turn your date into an unrelated number. For example, 3/3/2017 becomes 42797 when it's not formatted as a date.Insider receives a commission when you buy through our links.
