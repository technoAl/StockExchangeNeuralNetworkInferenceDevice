The curious PG Elektrus, unveiled in early 2012 and not heard about since, has just appeared for sale on Mobile.de in Germany and the asking price will blow your mind.Inspired by the first-generation Tesla Roadster, the Elektrus aimed to take what was a promising (yet flawed) electric sports car and make it better. Powering the Elektrus is a single electric motor delivering 270 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque that is allegedly good enough to send the sports car to 62 mph (100 km/h) in less than three seconds and a top speed close to 300 km/h (186 mph).At the time of the car’s unveiling, the small German outfit claimed it would build 667 examples but we can’t find any evidence that it produced more than two. Considering the car’s original claimed asking price exceeding $300,000, this is hardly a surprise.Also Read: Would The New Tesla Roadster Be Faster On Mars Than It Is On Earth?The listing states that this Elektrus was previously the demo car and hasn’t been driven all that much, showing 6,200 miles (10,000 km) on the clock. By comparison, the original prototype built has allegedly been driven for almost 62,000 miles (100,000 km).One of the interesting aspects of the PG Elektrus is that it is equipped with a sound system that allows the driver to select between different engine sounds, including an option that replicates that of a Formula 1 car.With a price tag of €250,000 ($275,000), it certainly doesn’t come cheap and justifying that price isn’t easy, particularly when you consider that some of the planet’s finest supercars can be purchased for less.Lotus Elise + Maserati GranTurismo + Tesla Roadster(gen1)roadster S was and still is betterNo.30k dollars is hard to be justified for this, let alone 275 thousands!Agreed. So how exactly is this any better than the original Tesla Roadster? Other than a few cosmetic differences, I don’t see the justification for the massive price hike.For a botched kit car at that.A+ for the effort.
