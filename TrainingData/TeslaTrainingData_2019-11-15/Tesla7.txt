A team of ducks crossing the road in Gisborne, New Zealand were saved when Tesla Autopilot sensed the fowl in the road and swerved at the last minute, narrowly avoiding them.According to the video's description, the driver of the Tesla Model 3 didn't notice the ducks because of a shadow on the road. But Autopilot did, and stepped in just in time, braking and veering into the adjacent empty lane."If it wasn't for the Autopilot function, I think the ducks would not have survived," the driver wrote. The ducks cut it close, and we definitely gasped at the near miss. Unfortunately, Autopilot does not perform seamlessly every time, and advancing car tech continues to be a topic of both interest and skepticism. But we're happy the ducks made it out unscathed. 'SNL' sends Harry Styles out for Popeyes in Jordan Peele's 'White Get Out''SNL' turns impeachment into the soap opera it's always been (with Jon Hamm)Harry Styles is all One Direction jokes in his 'SNL' monologueJeff Sessions grovels for Trump's approval on 'SNL' Weekend Update
