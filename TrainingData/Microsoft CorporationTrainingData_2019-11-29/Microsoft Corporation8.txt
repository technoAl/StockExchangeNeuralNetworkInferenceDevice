Now that we've tackled the good stuff, let’s go over how to best conquer Black Friday this year without getting trampled, wasting money, losing your sanity, etc.Some general tips:Black Friday will take place on the first Friday after Thanksgiving — Nov. 29, 2019. Walmart begins its in-store Black Friday sale at 6 pm local time on Thanksgiving, but their online sale will begin on Nov. 27 at 10 pm ET. (Valid through that Friday).None that we know of (yet). As you may know, going to physical store locations on Black Friday is always a risk, as shoppers tend to get a little too “passionate” about scoring the best deals possible. Luckily, the majority of Walmart’s in-store Black Friday discounts also track with their online shop. So, if you’re planning on doing most of your shopping at Walmart this time around, feel free to do it in your pajamas at home. (Note that some specific doorbuster sales are only available at physical locations. Try to pick these out ahead of time if you can, so you have a game plan.)
