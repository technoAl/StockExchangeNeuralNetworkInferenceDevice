Russia appears to be developing a new, small air-to-air missile that could arm the Su-57 stealth fighter. The United States also is working on smaller air-to-air missiles to arm its own growing force of radar-evading warplanes.The new missile appeared in a display at munitions-maker Vympel NPO's I. I. Toropov design facility in Moscow on Nov. 18, 2019, The War Zone reporter Joe Trevithick noted.The missile, the designation of which is not public, appears to be derived from the medium-range R-77-series missile, Trevithick explained. “However, it is significantly shorter than any of the variants in that family, as well as the R-74 and K-74M dogfighting missiles.”“This form factor seems ideally suited to meet space limitations of the small bays located under each of the wing roots of the Su-57 advanced combat aircraft,” Trevithick added.There’s growing demand among operators of stealth fighters for smaller missiles. Stealth jets such as the F-22, F-35 and Su-57 feature internal weapons bays that help to minimize the planes’ radar signatures. The size of the bays limits which weapons, and how many of them, the fighters can carry.The Pentagon is developing at least two new, small air-to-air missiles -- Peregrine and Cuda. The lack of internal space on the F-35 is driving the requirement for these and similar munitions.The F-35 famously can fit just two radar-guided AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles, or AMRAAMS, in its belly bay. In full stealth mode, with all its munitions tucked into the bay, the F-35 gets just two shots at enemy fighters before it must resort to dogfighting with its internal cannon. The F-35 is a notoriously poor dogfighter.Smaller missiles could solve that problem. Raytheon claimed Peregrine, which is six feet long and weighs 150 pounds, will have the same range as a 12-feet-long, 345-pound AMRAAM and maneuverability matching the 10-feet-long, 190-pound AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seaking missile.Read the original article.
