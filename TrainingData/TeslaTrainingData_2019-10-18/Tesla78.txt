Aaah, I love the Tesla! Just that once it runs out of battery, you are stuck.
A hybrid car is a better solution, specially one that works like a Prius.

I have never gotten stuck with my Tesla, but it does take a tiny bit of planning.

In daily use it takes as much planning as charging your phone. I have power in my garage, so I just come home and plug in. In the morning the car is topped off.

On trips. the Tesla itself does most of that for you since when you punch in a destination it adds in charging stops and time along the way. But it does depend where you drive. On almost all major roads in the US there are Superchargers or other fast DC chargers, which quickly fill the car, usually 20-30 minutes or less. They tend to be co-located with restaurants so by the time you eat and use the restroom the car is ready to go. In a pinch you can use AC chargers, and some of those are free, but they are slower. I usually only use those when I stop for the evening.

All and all I can't ever see buying another ICE car. Our other car, a BMW 3 series, just collects dust. We drive it maybe once a month to keep the battery charged.
