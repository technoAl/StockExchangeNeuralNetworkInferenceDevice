Have you thought about subscribing? It's free. seths.blog/subscribeSniffing at the others who care is a form of virtue signalling. It’s also an ineffective way to create real change.“My Prius Hybrid gets 140 miles per gallon.”“My Tesla is solar powered.”“Really, well I take an electric scooter.”“We carpool by sharing a horse.”“A horse? You should walk!”This misses the real problem: The 1998 Chevy Suburban, with just one person on board, doing a forty-mile commute at 12 miles per gallon.The same goes for ranking elected officials on who is the most perfect on the issue we care about.The people who are paying attention are the ones who are trying. And shaming people who are trying because they’re not perfect is a terrific way to discourage them from trying. On the other hand, the core of every system is filled with the status quo, a status quo that isn’t even paying attention.Focusing the group’s energy on shutting down strip-mined coal is going to make far more impact than scolding the few who are trying.
