Here's what we think.Because the revamped, bezel-less iPad Pro was too new during Black Friday 2018 to go on sale, it's pretty much guaranteed to be another sizzling doorbuster on Black Friday 2019. But the iPads that you can probably buy early are the 2018 9.7-inch iPad and the 2019 iPad Air. Both are old enough to be outshined but recent enough that retailers probably won't do some wild 50% off situation. Walmart has them both at all-time-low prices right now: Get the 9.7-inch iPad for $299 ($130.99 off, still full price at Best Buy) and the 10.2-inch iPad Air for $599 ($50 off and still full price at Apple's site). If you'd prefer to not be tethered to a place with WiFi, the 32GB WiFi + Cellular model is also on sale for $299 and the 128GB WiFi + Cellular model is on sale for $399 (both $160 off).

Despite a newer, one-inch-bigger classic iPad stealing the spotlight, the classic 9.7-inch iPad reinvented the affordable, reliable tablet. Its A10 Fushion chip was noticeably more powerful than any of Apple's "cheap" predecessors, and the 2,048 x 1,536 Retina display is one you probably won't find on budget tablets from other brands. The best update? The cheapest iPad finally works with the Apple Pencil, making it clutch for students, artists, or teachers.

There's a subconscious sense of confidence that comes when you own "Apple's best bang for your buck." That's what Mashable's tech reviewer calls the 2019 iPad Air. Armed with Apple's A12 Bionic chip, the newest Air is responsive and has sizzling fast loading times, even with multiple apps or 4K video running. Aside from older cameras and the old design with the home button, it's a seriously professional tablet in a thin, light package. The Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard are also finally supported.
