Published: November 8, 2019 Updated: November 8, 2019 7:59 AM EST Filed Under:The Maple Leafs nearly threw one away for this Throwback Thursday fan promotion.At times it looked like the rewind button on a VCR had gone all the way back to the bad old 1980s, a mostly dreary 0-0 game into the third period that stirred memories of Allan Bester vs. Kari Takko in a scoreless Leafs — North Stars’ match.But Frederik Andersen’s 37 saves, some of his best with Leafs short in the third period and start of overtime, kept the game alive for John Tavares’ 2-1 winner over the Vegas Golden Knights.Trailing on a Max Pacioretty goal that Leafs defenceman Cody Ceci put right on his stick, Toronto almost squandered six power plays before Auston Matthews scored late in the final attempt. Ugly or not, that’s three straight victories for the first time since late February of last season and Andersen has figured largely in all. Matthews led the rush off the bench to mob Andersen, not Tavares, at the end.Hurrying to hug Freddie.#LeafsForever pic.twitter.com/Ogeh4Jc7st“I know it’s pretty significant to give the three stars to only one person,” said Tavares of the Dane’s work against the Knights. “The saves he made in key moments, on the penalty kills in overtime and before overtime. Hell of a night by Fred.”It was the Leafs’ second flat start at SBA in what coach Mike Babcock hoped would be a turnaround week with three home games.“We’re 4-1-1 in our last six and Freddie’s gotten better just like he has each year,” Babcock said. “He seems to kick it into gear (after slow Octobers) and he’s an important part for us.”

 The crowd of 19,218 spent much of the evening grumbling and despite the Matthews goal to tie it midway through the third, the Leafs stumbled into a too-many-men penalty in the final minute of regulation. Andersen made bang-bang stops on Jonathan Marchessault in the dying seconds and got across to block Pacioretty in OT.The Leafs power play, which Matthews agreed in the morning could and should be the difference maker, was far too methodical and in love with multiple drop passes that gave Vegas plenty of time to adjust. It lost more ground in rankings to 17.2% and in the bottom third of the league, despite its advanced weaponry.After two Knights lost their sticks on the sixth Toronto advantage, Matthews finally snapped one past Malcolm Subban.The Leafs conclude the home stand in a rematch against the Flyers on Saturday, a week after the clubs went a Leaf-record 11 rounds in a shootout win.ANDERSEN’S ‘A’ GAMEAmidst the smattering of boos after two periods, the ‘Freddy’ chant could be heard as Andersen kept bailing out his slip shod teammates. Early in the game he gloved a Shea Theodore slot rocket on the same shift where Pacioretty rang one off the post.“It definitely felt like the puck was following me around a bit,” said Andersen. “It’s a good feeling. Subban (35 saves) played great, too. It was a fun one.”This was Andersen’s 205th Leafs game, tying him with Bester for 11th place in franchise history. He’s three away from passing James Reimer and cracking the top 10.GAME ONMitch Marner made the key poke check to send he and Tavares down ice 2-on-1, waiting until the last second to find the captain open for his first goal since he broke a finger three weeks ago.The game opened ominously for Toronto with Morgan Rielly over-skating a puck that Reilly Smith skimmed off the crossbar. The Leafs recovered for a number of close calls on hometown stopper Subban, helped by two early power plays. The Leafs are 3-for-33 in the power play since getting two against the Wild on Oct. 15.During one intermission, the out of town highlights showed ex-Leaf power play specialist James van Riemsdyk scoring for the Flyers, but Babcock used the second break in play and a TV timeout to try and relax both units.The Leafs did have to be extra careful with the 90% successful Knights penalty killing unit in town. And it seems the lower body injury that has kept Rielly away from off day practices lately has affected his shooting.“We had some really good looks, some good power plays and some that were hard to watch,” Babcock said. “But if you look at it, penalty killing was good for both teams (Vegas denied on five chances).”Toronto had given up a power-play goal in four straight games. Ilya Mikheyev nearly had a shortie for the Leafs late in the first.DERMOTT NOT SLOWED DOWNTravis Dermott is back to doing what he loves best, rushing a puck out of the Leafs zone in a burst from his own zone.“No one wants to play D-zone, it’s not our priority,” said Babcock Thursday morning. “We want to spend the whole game in the offensive zone, it’s more fun. The quicker you can get it back and execute, the better. If you’ve got skill to support it, if you can make a play on the offensive blue line and get it past good shot blockers — it’s hard to get it to the net today — those are the skills he has.”LOOSE LEAFSIt was Babcock’s 700th win, just the eighth in NHL history to do it … He said after the game that injured winger Zach Hyman would not be back until next week, taking the latter out of back-to-backs against the Flyers and Chicago Blackhawks with a look to Wednesday’s match on Long Island … Fred Gauthier nearly took one in the face from teammate Jake Muzzin on the penalty on a hard clearing pass … Rielly channelled Borje Salming on a flat out stretch to force a breaking Knights’ forward wide in the opening period … William Nylander nearly backhanded a puck past Subban while flat on the ice in the first, but his puck protection carelessness almost cost Toronto a few times.lhornby@postmedia.comWe encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.
