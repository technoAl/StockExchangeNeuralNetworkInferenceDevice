As it stands, they can force a tie for seventh place and battle in a playoff for the 8th seed."Big win for us," said Rain or Shine coach Caloy Garcia after the game. "Whatever happens, we showed heart today. We were able to beat a strong team, and that's a testament to the hard work of the locals.""Having (import) Rich (Ross) with the team changed a lot of things, and sayang -- sana maaga siya dumating," he added. "You can see that he's a winner, he wants to win."A win by Meralco would have knocked out the Elasto Painters from playoff contention, and the game appeared headed for that result after the Bolts took a 69-60 lead after three quarters.Ross, however, refused to let that happen. He anchored an 11-0 blast to open the final period, giving the Elasto Painters a 71-69 lead with 6:22 left.It was a tight game from there, with Meralco's Allen Durham knotting the count before a jumper by Ross gave the Elasto Painters gave the lead for good, 73-71, with 5:49 left.Nambatac drilled a booming triple with 4:19 to go for a 77-71 spread, and answered a Chris Newsome layup with a bucket of his own to maintain a 6-point advantage for ROS, 79-73.Meralco came to within two points, 79-77, off a Raymond Almazan putback before Norbert Torres' split at the line made it a three-point game.The E-Painters dodged a bullet when Durham bricked two charities with 1:50 to go, and Nambatac again came through when he lofted a floater over Durham for an 82-77 lead with 1:28 remaining.Meralco threatened anew when Almazan's putback of a miss by Newsome made it a one-point game, 82-81. They were still within distance, 83-81, after Jewel Ponferrada made just one of two charities.But out of a Meralco timeout, Nambatac came up with a big steal against Bong Quinto. The Bolts still had a chance when Durham blocked Ross on the other end and raced down the floor, but Almazan muffed his layup at the last second, allowing Rain or Shine to escape."Rey hit a big shot. We just have to hope for the next game," said Garcia, referring to the upcoming Ginebra-NorthPort game. A win by the Batang Pier will eliminate the Elasto Painters.Ross finished with 26 points and 12 rebounds, while Nambatac had 24 points on 10-of-13 shooting along with 4 assists and 3 rebounds.Squandered in the loss was a 23-point, 16-rebound output by Durham, and Almazan's 18-point, 19-rebound double-double.The Bolts finished the elimination round with an 8-3 record. They are already assured of a twice-to-beat advantage in the quarterfinals.The scores:Rain or Shine 83 - Ross 26, Nambatac 24, Exciminiano 8, Borboran 4, Ponferada 4, Mocon 4, Norwood 4, Rosales 3, Torres 3, Belga 3, Daquioag 0.Meralco 81 - Durham 23, Amer 18, Almazan 18, Newsome 12, Quinto 6, Pinto 2, Caram 2, Faundo 0, Hodge 0, Salva 0.Quarterscores: 23-21, 41-42, 60-69, 83-81.ShareWATCH: Michelle Dee’s Miss World introduction reelDecember 05, 2019Gilas shuts down SingaporeDecember 05, 2019Deiparine ends droughtDecember 05, 2019Ilang lugar, isinailalim sa state of calamity dahil sa bagyong TisoyDecember 04, 2019SEA Games: Vic Manuel flexes his muscle in strong Gilas debutDecember 04, 20193 estudyante, timbog sa buy-bust sa TaguigDecember 04, 2019SEA Games: Alyssa, PH team stay positive after loss to VietnamDecember 04, 2019SEA Games: Efren 'Bata' Reyes outclasses Thai opponent in one carom cushionDecember 04, 2019SEA Games: Philippines maintains overall medal tally leadDecember 04, 2019Ride-hailing app Angkas hopes for extension of pilot runDecember 04, 2019'No Time to Die': First trailer for Daniel Craig's final outing as James BondDecember 04, 2019Eyes on the prizeDecember 04, 2019Kampanya kontra pangongopya ng isang guro, patok sa social mediaDecember 04, 20195 masahista, tiklo sa higit P400,000 halaga ng ilegal na drogaDecember 04, 2019Guro nanadyak at nanabunot umano ng estudyante sa LaoagDecember 04, 2019Deutsche Telekom 5G deals on hold pending Huawei ban decisionDecember 04, 2019WATCH: Anne cries upon hearing Teddy’s unexpected birthday wishDecember 04, 2019SEA Games: Bianca Pagdanganan leads Day 1 leaderboard in women’s golfDecember 04, 2019SEA Games: Gilas opens title-retention campaign with rout of SingaporeDecember 04, 2019SEA Games: Pinoy netizens nagpahayag ng suporta para sa Timor LesteDecember 04, 2019© 2019 ABS-CBN Corporation.
