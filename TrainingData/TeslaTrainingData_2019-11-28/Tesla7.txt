Consumer tech giant Best Buy released their Black Friday 2019 ad in the wee hours of Nov. 7.Any other time, this wouldn't be that big of a deal. What's the rush when the sales aren't starting until Thanksgiving, right? Think again. A slew of the deals in Best Buy's huge, 115-page ad scan went live early. Through Nov. 10, you can grab the new Microsoft Surface Pro 7, Apple devices, Bose headphones, Samsung and Sony 4K TVs, and more at their Black Friday price. 
If you see something on your shopping list as part of these early deals, it's probably smart to snag it now instead of hoping for a better deal in a few weeks. This might be Best Buy's way of diverting chaos over the big shopping weekend.Deals that activate on Nov. 28 include way more TVs, an Xbox bundle with Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active. Our friends at BestBlackFriday.com say that Best Buy's best offerings are on TVs and home entertainment systems, and that's made clear by the fact that the ad scan has multiple pages dedicated to TV deals and soundbars. As of this writing, Walmart and Amazon have yet to release full Black Friday ads, so Best Buy is currently the only retailer offering an Xbox bundle with the new Star Wars game. (We predict that won't last long, though.)SEE ALSO: These are the Black Friday sales worth waiting forAs for Best Buy's official Black Friday hours, doors open on Thanksgiving Day at 5 pm and close at 1 am. On actual Black Friday, doors open back up at 8 am. For both openings, lucky stand-by customers will get tickets one hour before the store opens. (It's like trying to get into a taping of Saturday Night Live.) Of course, you can obviously shop online 24/7.If you prefer to shop in-store though, make sure you check out the online listing for the item you're eyeing. Best Buy is tacking on some freebies to a lot of TVs and gaming consoles, including discounts on Sling TV, free Echo Dots, and free screen protectors. We're not sure how these will be advertised in store and you don't want to miss out.Here are our favorite Best Buy Black Friday 2019 deals. Sales that are live through Nov. 10 are in bold:
