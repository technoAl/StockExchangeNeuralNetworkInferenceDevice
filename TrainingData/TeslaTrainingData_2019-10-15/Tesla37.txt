Tesla is back at Nürburgring. Two Tesla Model S cars have been spotted (via Teslarati) on the legendary German race track, and while there are no official lap times for them yet, the cars themselves are interesting. Back in September, when Tesla cars were first spotted at Nürburgring, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that their (unofficial) track times will be "beaten by the actual production 7 seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct/Nov next year." While we can't say whether they're 7- or 5-seaters, the new Tesla cars seen whizzing on the race track (see video below) have some new features, including air vents on the front and a big rear diffuser (only on the blue Model S, though). Again, Elon Musk chimed in on Twitter to say that the final configuration that will be used at the racetrack is the car that will actually go into production by summer 2020. The final configuration used at Nürburgring to set the record will go into production around summer 2020, so this is not merely for the track— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 16, 2019It's unclear, however, whether the production version will be configurable to have all the details we've seen on these cars in Germany, including the wide body kit, spoilers, air vents, and diffusors. Tesla's mission at Nürburgring is quite simple: The company is trying to beat the 7:42 Nürburgring Nordschleife lap time recently set by Porsche's electric Taycan, and — if possible — take some kind of crown there, perhaps for the fastest electric sedan. Last month, Tesla allegedly did the lap in 7:23, but that's not an officially measured result. Meanwhile, a Porsche Taycan Turbo S beat a Tesla Model S P100D in a drag race, though it's worth noting that we don't know what kind of tires were used on either car. The rivalry lives on.
