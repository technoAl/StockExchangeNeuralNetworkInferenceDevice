Tesla is scheduled to release  third-quarter earnings after the market close on Wednesday, and  investors will be keen to see how close the automaker is to  returning to profitability.  Wall Street is expecting Tesla to post a roughly $52 million loss  on $6.45 billion in revenue for the period. During the same  quarter last year, the company reported a profit of $343 million  on $6.82 billion in sales. Tesla last reported a profit in the  fourth quarter of 2018.  Some analysts warned that this quarter's results might not be  pretty following disappointing vehicle-production data reported  earlier this month.  Tesla said it produced 96,155 vehicles and delivered 97,000  during the third quarter. That set a company record but still  fell at the lower end of consensus analyst estimates of 95,000 to  100,000.  The news sent shares   falling about 7% as investors grew concerned that the company  might miss its ambitious goal of delivering 360,000 to 400,000  cars in 2019.Read more:  An investor who got in early on a small tech stock that's earned  110% this year shares the book that helps him spot explosive  companies - and explains how it's changed his worldview  The combination of profitability and delivery concerns has  weighed heavily on the stock this year. Shares were down 23%  year-to-date through Tuesday's close, compared with the S&P  500's gain of close to 20% over the period.  Wednesday's results will be critical for the company to prove to  investors that it can shrink losses and meet delivery targets.  Here's what Wall Street analysts are saying about Tesla's path to  profitability and delivery estimates ahead of its third-quarter  earnings report:Price target: $189Rating: Underperform  "Tesla is likely to post its first y/y negative revenue growth  quarter since 2012, and we expect gross margins down modestly  sequentially," the Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy wrote in a note  to clients in early October.  Levy added: "Post the deliveries release, we revise our 3Q y/y  revenue growth estimate to -8%."Price target: $200Rating: Underweight  "We remain cautious on shares of Underweight-rated TSLA on lofty  valuation coupled with high investor expectations, high execution  risk, and the potential for a pending cut to full-year delivery  guidance at the time of 3Q earnings," JPMorgan analysts wrote in  a note to clients on Friday.Price target: $220Rating: Neutral  "We continue to believe the biggest overhang around the story is  the ability to hit profitability and achieve its ambitious unit  guidance for 2019 of 360k to 400k units," the Wedbush analyst  Daniel Ives wrote in a note to clients on Friday.  Ives continued: "Balancing the ability to hit these goals with a  profitable business model remains the crux of the story for Tesla  as gross margins (driving 20%+ GM key) need to tick up despite  selling a markedly lower priced Model 3 vehicle going forward."Price target: $224Rating: Neutral  "The 3Q19 deliveries number was a miss, so we think investors  need to carefully analyze pressures causing weakness," Roth  Capital analysts wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.  They added: "Tesla's weak 3Q19 is already telegraphed. With the  97k deliveries in the quarter, below our 105k estimate, both  revenue and EPS should be light."Price target: $400Rating: Outperform  "With some seasonal tailwinds, we believe achieving the lower end  of its 360-400k for the year as feasible," Macquarie analysts  wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.  They added: "We will look for an update on the feasibility of Mr.  Musk's 2,000 unit/week production target for 2019 year end. In  addition, we will watch for any indication of a potential pull  forward of Model Y launch in 2020."Your Personalized Market Center
