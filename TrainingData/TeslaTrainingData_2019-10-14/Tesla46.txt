It was a dark, stormy Friday, November 1 (well, depending on where you live), when Elon Musk said he's done with Twitter."Going offline," he tweeted, after a short musing on whether the social media site is worth it. "Not sure about good of Twitter," he wrote. It was clear he'd had enough. Was he ever coming back, the internet wondered?Well, four days later, Musk is tweeting again! On Monday, he tweeted about the SpaceX's recent parachute test for the Crew Dragon capsule. Great work by SpaceX Dragon team & Airborne! To be clear, we’ve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row. https://t.co/Q814zVoW4S— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 4, 2019It appears the tweet wasn't just a one-time thing, because Musk followed with a few more tweets after that. Hopefully, the Tesla/SpaceX/Neuralink/Boring Company CEO has gotten some rest from social media in these four days, and will now continue to bring us news, exclusive videos and questionably funny memes.
