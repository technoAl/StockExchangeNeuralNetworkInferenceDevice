That's the lowest price we've seen in a while.Editor's Note: Alas, this deal is no longer available. Amazon listed it as "currently unavailable" shortly after this post went up.If you're looking to renew your Sony PlayStation Plus membership or just buy one for the first time, Amazon is selling a digital code for a 12-month membership for $24.88 -- or $35.11 off the normal list price of $60. You frequently see discounts on digital codes for PSN Plus subscriptions but they're almost never this good and they're usually from sites eBay, CDKeys and similar scenes. This is the cheapest I've seen a 12-month subscription on Amazon in a while.Amazon limits you to two subscription code purchases per transaction. I was able to buy a total of four years in two separate transactions -- that seems to be the limit. Codes are sent to your Amazon account (you can find them in your "Digital games and software" section on your account page under "Digital content and devices"). Sometimes the code arrives right away, other times there can be a short wait (occasionally, it takes a few hours to arrive).   Be respectful, keep it civil and stay on topic.
