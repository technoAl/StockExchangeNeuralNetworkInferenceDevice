ICYMI (In case you missed it) – Tuesday’s Python on Microcontrollers Newsletter from AdafruitDaily.com went out.If you missed it, subscribe now!The next newsletter goes out in a week and being subscribed the best way to keep up with all things Python for hardware.Over 6,777 subscribers worldwide!The Adafruit Feather is the latest platform for microcontroller development, and companies like Particle, SparkFun, and Seeed Studios are producing Feather-compatible devices for development and prototyping. Now it’s your turn. Design a board to fit in the Feather ecosystem and we’ll manufacture it. The best project in the Take Flight With Feather contest will be sent off to pick and place machines and head straight to the Digi-Key warehouse!To get started, take a look at the current Feather ecosystem and get acquainted with the GitHub repo filled with examples and tutorials.For the Take Flight With Feather contest, we’re looking for the cool, the useful, the insane, and the practical. Most of all, we’re looking for manufacturability. Electron savant Ladyada will be judging each board on the basis of manufacturability, with the best board moving on to the assembly line where it will be stocked at Digi-Key.What’s a good design? We’re looking for submissions in the following categories:The winning entry overall will be chosen for manufacturability, and will win a small manufacturing run of 100 boards or less and be stocked at Digi-Key. The number of boards in the manufacturing run will be determined by the winning design. Note: Because of the small run initially, there will be no profit or margin for the first few boards. If the board is well accepted and a larger run is planned, then a longer term business model will be addressed. The 5 winners in the 5 categories above will receive $100 Tindie gift certificates. To get started, start a project on hackaday.io and upload your project. Contest runs noon November 1 to noon December 31st. All times are in Pacific Standard Time.Stop by hackaday.io for more details!This is the fifth alpha release of CircuitPython 5.0.0. Alpha releases are meant for testing.

Every single day in October, we posted up some open source stories from the last decade (and more!) about open source hardware, open source software, interviews, stats, and more. Here are all 35 posts in one spot, enjoy!Python creator Guido van Rossum is retiring from DropBox. This is a great quote:“…in 2013, Guido joined Dropbox. Since then, he has not only made contributions to Python at Dropbox, but also left an everlasting impact on our engineering culture and our people. It started with some of the young engineers Guido met early on. “There was a small number of really smart, really young coders who produced a lot of very clever code that only they could understand,” said van Rossum. “That is probably the right attitude to have when you’re a really small startup.” But as the company grew, new engineers who joined couldn’t understand the code. Clever code is usually short and cryptic, written by and for the individual who came up with it, but is hard for anyone else to understand—and nearly impossible to maintain. Guido called this “cowboy coding culture”. He recognized its value in our early stages of trying to implement things quickly, but knew it wouldn’t be sustainable over time, so he decided to speak up in his own quiet way. “When asked, I would give people my opinion that maintainable code is more important than clever code,” he said. “If I encountered clever code that was particularly cryptic, and I had to do some maintenance on it, I would probably rewrite it. So I led by example, and also by talking to other people.”Thank you, Guido from the Dropbox Team.If you’re interested in mixing Python and LEGO, there is an upcoming starting Crowd Supply campaign for snekboard in a couple of weeks.

I can disgust those Trick-or-Treaters with this wonderfully flatulent trick–now with fart-flavored fragrance! This ceramic gourd is stuffed with electronics to emit light, sound, fog, and a little bit of stink. A passive infrared (PIR) sensor detects the presence of warm bodies and triggers the whole fart sequence. An Adafruit Feather M0 Express running #CircuitPython controls the lights (NeoPixels) and plays an audio clip out through pin A0. The fog machine is a vape pen loaded with half fog juice and half liquid fart.

Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:What’s going on this week? A LOT!BryanThis week I did some guide work to prepare for some upcoming sensors. For one of them, the LSM303AGR, I spent some time working on the test code and tester PCB. Once we’ve prototyped the tester on a breadboard, we of course need to make something more robust for actually production use, so we commit the design to a PCB and get something like so:The end result is not unlike the test jigs shown in this guide.DanI finished reviewing Scott’s extensive updates to the _bleio native module and adafruit_ble library. We discussed it further, and after a few more updates, it is ready to go. I added new CircuitPython board definitions for the ItsyBitsy nRF52840 and Arduino Nano 33 BLE boards. I also changed the Circuit Playground Bluefruit board to include two I2C devices so that we can support both the onboard I2C accelerometer and any offboard I2C devices. The CircuitPython 5.0.0-alpha.5 release is now available, as of Sunday night! It includes a number of new boards and many fixes. It does not include the BLE changes mentioned above: we’ll be making another alpha or beta release soon to focus on those changes.KattniAs well as testing hardware on Raspberry Pi, I’ve worked on new and updated guides this week! There’s now a new guide for the STEMMA Non-Latching Mini Relay with wiring and code examples. Take control of power with the ease of STEMMA! If you’re looking to use your Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor on Raspberry Pi, check out the updated guide which now includes updated code for use on Raspberry Pi with the Adafruit Blinka library. Next up is testing Raspberry Pi with the VC0706 TTL serial camera, the MPR121 HAT, and the PM2.5 air quality sensor, including guide updates for each. Keep an eye out for an update to the micro lipo guide to include the new USB-C lipo charger, and for a new guide for the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor. All this and more coming soon!LucianThis past week saw major progress on overcoming chronic issues with the PWM and UART modules on STM32. Now that those are close to concluding, it’s time to start work on cleanup and support expansion in earnest, with a number of smaller PRs aimed at getting the greatest breadth of library support possible on the newly released Feather F405. I’m also looking forward to revisiting the small pile of new boards and device modules on my desk, expanding the STM32 board profile collection and number of tested FeatherWings available for them.MelissaThis last week, I finished adding a couple of pages to the Mini PiTFT guide. I also updated the Nokia LCD guide to add CircuitPython and Raspberry Python sections and fixed an issue with the WS2801 LEDs not working correctly on Blinka. I also updated the CircUp guide to reflect the latest features that have been added and the installation being made a lot easier through PyPI. Finally, I just finished up updating the Sharp Memory Display guide. You can check out those guides at these links:I’m currently freshening the WS2801 guide and adding sections for using CircuitPython and Python. After that I’ll be moving onto either SSD1305 displays and the IS31FL3731 Charlieplexed LEDs.ScottI spent most of the last week visiting family and taking a break from work. I got back last Thursday feeling refreshed and jumped right back into BLE library tweaks. Thanks to Dan and Thea’s help, I made good progress on wrapping up the BLE changes just in time for me to go soak up some sun in Florida.The Hackaday Superconference is November 15th, 16th, and 17th in Pasadena, California, USA.
