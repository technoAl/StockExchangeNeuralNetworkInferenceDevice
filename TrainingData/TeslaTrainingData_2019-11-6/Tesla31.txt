in Music, Random |   	March 15th, 2012  2 CommentsYou can create music with Tesla coils if you know how to modulate their "break rate" with MIDI data and a control unit. Case in point. Here we have two solid state musical Tesla coils, using a combined 24KW of power, to play a version of Lynyrd Skynyrd's 1974 classic "Sweet Home Alabama" (listen to the original here). Also enjoy electrified versions of House of The Rising Sun and Dueling Banjos. via @webacionMore Culture from our Twitter Stream:Jack Kerouac's Only Full-Length Play Will Premiere, 55 years After It Was WrittenFirst MITx Course Attracts 90,000 Students, Proving the Popularity of Online Learning.
