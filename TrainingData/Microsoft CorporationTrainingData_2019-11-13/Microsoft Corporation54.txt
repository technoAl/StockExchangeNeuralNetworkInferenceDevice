Zlatan Ibrahimovic announced his departure from LA Galaxy on Wednesday, ending his two-year stint with the team as one of the most electrifying players in MLS."I came, I saw, I conquered," Zlatan wrote in his farewell tweet."Thank you LA Galaxy for making me feel alive again. To the Galaxy fans - you wanted Zlatan, I gave you Zlatan. You are welcome. The story continues...Now go back to watch baseball."It was a farewell fitting for Zlatan, who has compared himself to a god in the past.When he was initially signed by the Galaxy, Zlatan announced his arrival in MLS with similar grandeur, taking out a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times that said simply, "Dear Los Angeles, You're welcome."But for all the bluster, Zlatan's play often lived up to the sky-high expectations he set for himself.Ibrahimovic's first appearance came as a substitute in the 70th minute against crosstown rivals LAFC. Zlatan scored an absurd game-tying goal just five minutes into that debut and followed it up by punching in the game-winner in stoppage time.Despite the phenomenal debut, Ibrahimovic was unable to win any hardware with the Galaxy, but he did provide a near-endless stream of highlights on the field.He scored the 500th goal of his career on a roundhouse kick that few players on the planet would even dream of attempting. He hit played a bicycle kick to himself so perfectly even he was impressed. Through it all, he was an egomaniac that handled media like no other superstar in sports.Ibrahimovic's goodbye tweet was not the first time he's produced a wild farewell to a former team, as his final posts as a member of Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United came with a similar lack of humility.At 38, it's unclear where Zlatan plans for the future are, though a return to Europe for one more ride is not out of the question.Wherever he ends up, Zlatan will undoubtedly announce his arrival in a way that's tough to miss.Real Madrid is reportedly considering spending more than half a billion dollars to snatch PSG's 20-year-old French forward Kylian Mbappe away from BarcelonaNFL POWER RANKINGS: Where every team stands heading into Week 11Thierry Henry says France can win Euro 2020 but warns Cristiano Ronaldo will want to go out on a high in what would be his last international tournament'Monday Night Football' commentator under fire after belittling criticism of 49ers kicker for missed field goal
