A great deal on Sony Noise Canceling Headphones, a popular Marshall Stanmore II Speaker, and an Ugg Flash Sale at Nordstrom Rack lead off Thursday’s best deals.            Bookmark Kinja Deals and follow us on Twitter to never miss a deal.I thought I’d seen it all in the USB battery pack space, but RAVPower went and made something completely new: a battery pack that you can recharge with literally any phone charger you have lying around. Yes, it features USB-C, microUSB, and even Lightning inputs.The 18W USB-C PD input will be by far the fastest recharge option, but it’s nice to know that any cord you have lying around will be capable of juicing up the battery pack overnight.That USB-C port is also an 18W output port, which can charge an iPhone from 0% to 50% in 30 minutes with the right cable. You also get two standard USB outputs, one of which features Quick Charge 3.0, all tied to a 20,000mAh battery. The lowkey nicest feature though might be the screen that displays your remaining battery life as an actual percentage, rather than an array of like, three or four dots.A few years ago, Apple started adding USB-C fast charging support to its iPhones (iPhone 8 and…The battery is priced at $50, which isn’t out of line for a USB-C PD battery of this size, but if you clip the $5 coupon and use promo code KINJAK172 at checkout, you can get it for just $35.Update: These were briefly available for $228, but have since risen to $278, which would otherwise still be the best deal Amazon’s ever listed on them.Sony’s WH1000XM3s are probably the best noise canceling over ears money can buy, and Amazon just dropped $120 off their price tag seemingly out of nowhere. If you listen to what Sony says, you could assume that the third generation of the Sony 1000X…$50 discounts on these things aren’t too uncommon, but this is far and away the best deal we’ve ever seen on them. If you spend a lot of time on planes, commute on trains, or just work in an accursed open office, this will be the best $228 you spend this year. Promise.If you’re a glutton for storage space, Western Digital has a 12TB external USB 3.0 drive that might be hard for you to pass up. For $179, you could store hundreds of movies, millions of songs, or <checks notes> over 8 billion pages of text files? Hey, whatever you need, friend.Best of all, WD drives are often shuckable, meaning you can pry them open, pull out the internal hard drive and mount it in your own custom NAS. Sometimes external drives like this one are cheaper than buying the hard drives directly and, well, 12TB for $179 is nothing to sneeze at.If you have a NAS or other high-capacity storage device at home, you know how expensive those… 4K TVs are getting cheaper than ever. Today, LG’s 60" 4K TV with HDR is down to a low $400 over at Best Buy. If you fancy something just a little bit bigger, you can head over to Walmart to find a 65" version of LG’s 4K TV, also with HDR, for just $478.  That extra 5" may not sound like a lot, but you can check out the difference at this comparison site here. Five more inches amounts to about 17% more screen real estate. And the 65" model is about 19% more expensive. Yep, that checks out. A soundbar is a simplified way to give your home theater that surround sound treatment, and this $278 soundbar from Samsung made in partnership with Harman Kardon is a powerful option to do it. You’ll have to run cables to the rear speakers, but everything else is contained in the front bar. This soundbar is usually over $400, but this is the first time we’ve seen it dip down into this price range.  Corsair makes some of our readers’ mechanical keyboards. So it’s exciting that the Corsair K70 is down to an all-time low price of $72. And, as expected, it seems to be a popular deal. Currently, the keyboard is on backorder, but you can still buy it. It just might take a few weeks to get to you. At the time of writing, Amazon estimates the keyboard will be back in stock on November 21st. If you can handle the wait, though, you’ll be rewarded with a fantastic keyboard for a pretty-good-keyboard price. Tiny car chargers like this one have been massive hits with our readers for years, because they have that built-into-your-car look, but charge your phone much faster than the piddly USB port your car probably includes.You buy a lot of car chargers, but this Aukey model sits nearly flush in your cigarette lighter…Now, Anker has a mini car charger of its own, it can charge two phones at 12W simultaneously, and it’s down to $10 (from $15) today on Amazon with promo code ANKERMETAL2.Note: As of the time of this writing, there’s currently a Lightning Deal running on the charger for the exact same price. But if that expires, promo code ANKERMETAL2 will still get you the deal.Nomad has long made some of the best and most beautifully designed mobile accessories you can buy, and you can snag any full-priced item on their site for 20% off with promo code RUSH20.Nomad makes some of our favorite charging accessories, including my current (get it?) external…One cable to rule them all.The brand’s newest flagship product is the Base Station wireless charging pad, which can charge two Qi-powered devices at once, as well as an Apple Watch.

The Stanmore II upped the volume with higher powered drivers and Bluetooth 5.0, and it’s marked down to an all-time low $200 on Amazon right now. Go rock out with your credit card out.If you’re an Amazon Prime member and if you pay your credit card bills off every month, then there’s a really good chance you already have an Amazon Prime credit card to get that sweet, sweet 5% cash back on every purchase. For a limited time though, you can boost that 5% to as much as 20% on select products throughout the store, including a bunch of brand name tech.You can find all of the eligible items on this page, and we’ve highlighted a few of our favorites below. If you have a Prime credit card tied to your account, you should also see the offer in small print on the individual product page.Also note that in many cases, the bonus applies to multiple SKUs within the same product family (i.e. the promotional page lists this 128GB microSD card as being eligible for 15% cash back, but you’ll get the same offer for 64GB, 256GB, and 512GB cards as well as long as they’re shipped and sold by Amazon).Yamaha YAS-207BL | $170 | AmazonThere are so many cloud-connected security cameras on the market, you’d think they’d be a dime a…If you’re a NordVPN customer, you may have heard about a long-undisclosed security breach this week, and thus might be in the market for a new VPN provider. And even if you have no idea what I’m referring to, it might be worth signing up for a VPN service anyway, which can protect your privacy when browsing the web, and even let you access content from certain sites and streaming video providers that aren’t available in your physical location (Love Island, anyone?) You may know what a VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is; you probably don’t use one. You really…Hackers have busted into servers of at least three popular VPN services—NordVPN, VikingVPN, and…Private Internet Access has long been our readers’ favorite VPN service thanks to its low prices, its speed, and its excellent apps for every major platform. And now with the news of the NordVPN hack, they’re offering the best price we’ve ever seen on an annual subscription: $29 for the whole year.

You can choose from tiny trees under six feet, or massive 10-foot trees that will make your home look like the center of a shopping mall.It’s 2019, and your vacuum shouldn’t have a cord anymore. Dyson’s V-series stick vacs have long been go-to cordless options, but the powerful V10 was arguably the first that could truly, completely replace a corded vacuum, at least for smaller homes. In fact, Dyson stopped developing corded vacuums, because the V10 was that good (and has since been improved upon slightly with the V11). The Dyson upright ball vacuum, an iconic piece of engineering and design that made vacs a gadget…Two models in the V10 line are marked down to new all-time low prices on Amazon right now. The Animal model has a larger bin, a more powerful cleaning head, and more included accessories, and seems well worth the extra $50 vs. the standard Motorhead, for our money. If you’re hooked on smooth, caffeine-rich cold brew coffee, you can save a lot of money by making it at home, and KitchenAid’s brewer is the nicest looking option we’ve seen.Just put coarse coffee grounds in the hopper, add water, and take the grounds out after a day or so.

If you’re not into hard side luggage, you can get this U.S. Traveler Vineyard 4-Piece Softside Luggage Set for only $80.We often promote a lot of candy deals, which is amazing. But obviously, we should probably also suggest moderately healthy snacks as well. Thankfully, today’s Blue Diamond Gold Box gives us that chance. Plain almonds are kind of a snore. Spice things up with a bag of Wasabi & Soy Sauce or Habanero BBQ almonds to actually enjoy this healthy snack.In Anker’s long, proud line of robotic vacuums, the RoboVac 35c stands as one of the most powerful, and most smart. Its slim 2.85" thick chassis can slide under most furniture, and its 1500pa suction is on par with a “real” stick vacuum.The 35c also boasts Wi-Fi, so you can schedule it with an app, control it with Alexa, and even invoke a Find My Robot feature that lets you trigger an audible alarm with your phone if it gets lost under some furniture, and you’re having trouble locating it.Today at Walmart, the 35c is down to an all-time low $179, which is well worth the hours you’ll save not having to vacuum by hand.Herbs may not be very exciting. They might not add a ton of flavor to your food. They’re not the prettiest plants either. You wouldn’t buy a bouquet of herbs for your sweetheart. But at least it’s satisfying to grow herbs of your own, and with Amazon’s 30% off sale you can buy herbs like lemon thyme for $17, plant food for $16, and tools like a drop spreader for $39 to start your very own herb garden.There may not be stiff competition for most baller office equipment—and the fax machine sure isn’t winning it anytime soon—but if there were, obviously label makers would win. They’re cool. Having a dedicated printer for your labels printers is like having a sedia gestatoria to carry around your pope. How luxurious, how absolutely regal do labels have to be to get their own special printer?And none are cooler than this handheld Dymo label maker, currently just $20. That’s cheaper than we’ve seen it in over a year. If you’re feeling fancier, today’s Dymo label sale has plenty more models, including this standalone Dymo label printer for $50, 10 shipping label rolls for $90, and even heat shrink tube labels for $19.Dyson’s eBay outlet is always a great place to save on Dyson gear, but for a limited time, you can save an extra 20% on the already-discounted prices with promo code JUMBO20, including vacuums, fans, and even hair dryers. They sell a lot of new stuff on eBay, but the best deals are on the refurbs. Either way, they’re sold directly by Dyson; this isn’t a sketchy third party situation.My favorite pick here would be the cordless Dyson V7 Animal (refurbished) for $170. If you want a corded upright, the Dyson Cinetic doesn’t require a filter, and is a great option at $300 brand new. Just don’t forget the code!The Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer really is worthy of the hype, and $220 with code JUMBO20 for a certified refurb is an absolute steal compared to its $400 MSRP.No one should need or want a $400 hair dryer. The number one hair dryer on Amazon costs $36, the…For a generic brand, AmazonBasics has pretty reliable variety of products and right now many of the products you’d need around your house are on sale for up to 30% off.Rechargeable AA batteries and AAA batteries are starring the show, with 15% off of 4- or 8-packs.

To see all of the other deals, head over to Amazon here.Go take a look at your international travel bucket list, because there’s a pretty good chance one of those destinations is included in Emirates’ big International Sale.The best way to sort through the best deals is to select your departure airport from the dropdown menu on this page (13 U.S. airports are included), leave the destination blank, and hit search. You’ll then see a list of the best economy and business class fares, and you can also drill down on the available inventory with the search tools to only see fares for certain months, or in certain price ranges.The cheapest flight we saw was from JFK to Milan for $459 roundtrip (in a double decker A380!), but as you’d expect from Emirates, there are also lots of options to far-flung destinations in the middle east, Asia, and Africa as well.These fares are available (while supplies last, obviously) until November 12, and most seem to be valid for select travel days between November or December and May. Personally, I suggest finding a cheap flight you want now, and figuring out the rest of your vacation details later. That’s exactly what I did with a cheap flight from Newark to Athens in a previous Emirates sale, and now I have the entire trip planned out.If it’s your dream to get some solid shut-eye for once in your life, why not give melatonin gummies a try?

To say that Akira is one of the most important movies—at the very least, one of the most important anime films—in history wouldn’t be overstatement. This classic from 1988 not only helped form the cyberpunk subgenre, but set animation standards that anime still follows to this day. $7 for a film like that is, frankly, a steal. But if Akira isn’t your speed, Vudu is offering a few other fantastic anime films for $7 as well, including Perfect Blue, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, as well as the 2016 Ghost in the Shell: The New Movie, and Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods.We all know that the GameCube controller is the only appropriate controller for Super Smash Bros., and now you can use one for Smash Ultimate on your Switch, no wires required.Smash Bros. players are often as particular about the controllers they use as they are which…PowerA’s GameCube gamepad connects to your Switch over Bluetooth, no dongles required, and includes everything you need to play every modern Switch game, including home and screenshot buttons, and L3 and R3 clickable sticks, which the original GameCube controller lacked.

This $17 Buttheads Fart Launcher 3000 might seem moronic, but the whole family will laugh when you bust this out. In reality, I can imagine many adults without any kids will get amusement out of this. The PS4-exclusive Horizon Zero Dawn is a fantastic, open-world sandbox game where you hunt monsters, crawl through dungeons, and uncover the secrets of what happened to the vaguely post-post-apocalypse you find yourself in.  It’s a stellar game with one major flaw: it came out one week before The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. For that reason, you might’ve missed it when it came out, but the game is now down to a mere $14, and includes the DLC expansion The Frozen Wilds.

The 1 oz. bottle is rarely discounted from its usual $45, but Amazon’s rolled it back to $38 in what’s sure to be a sale as fleeting as youth itself.Should you use serums? I guess it depends. If you want to avoid looking like Rick the Hormone…Here’s what our own Megan Collins had to say about it:It’s pumped full of collagen-boosting peptides to help skin look smoother, lifted and more toned. Plus, white willow bark exfoliates to make dull skin look more radiant. Yes, radiant I said goddamnit!It is already November and that means the slightly warmer temperatures are officially gone.

Pretty much everyone knows how to play, everyone owns a copy, and it’s a good default activity for a small group of people. There are better German-style board games (in the same way that Life or Clue is better than Monopoly), but at least Catan is a lot better than Monopoly.There have been a few deals on various styles of Catan lately, but $30 is a really good price for the standard edition.
