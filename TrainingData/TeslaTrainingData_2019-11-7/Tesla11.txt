SpaceX's boss entertains a long-time dream of colonizing Mars. His California-based company has so far received authorization from US authorities to launch 12,000 satellites in several different orbits, and it has applied to launch as many as 30,000 more. Starlink is designed to provide high-speed internet connections on Earth. Its mini-satellites will orbit at relatively low altitude (550 kilometers, or 340 miles, for the first ones), allowing quick transmission times. SpaceX says its satellite constellation will be operational for Canada and the northern US by next year. It says 24 more launches will be needed to extend coverage to the entire globe. At present, there are slightly more than 2,100 active satellites in orbit around the Earth. The idea of adding 42,000 has some scientists worried.Astronomers say the proliferation of the bright metallic satellites could seriously degrade the night view, interfering with telescopes trained on space.Others fear that the far more crowded skies will result in expensive collisions between satellites. ShareLISTEN: Regine, Moira release original duet ‘Unbreakable’November 12, 2019Patch Magtanong finishes in Top 8 of Miss InternationalNovember 12, 2019GrabFood rider hinoldap, tinangayan ng motorsiklo sa QCNovember 12, 2019Tap to order, wireless charging in new Jollibee storesNovember 12, 2019LOOK: Kylie Verzosa interviews Patch MagtanongNovember 12, 2019SEA Games: Alapag confident Gilas will be 'fine' despite loss to AlabNovember 12, 2019Bandalismo sa bagong-linis na underpass sa Maynila, kinondenaNovember 12, 2019'Di masamang tao': Jobert Sucaldito tinanggap ang sorry ni MorissetteNovember 12, 2019Abogadong nangaliwa, nagkunwaring senior citizen na-disbarNovember 12, 2019READ: Patch Magtanong’s Miss International 2019 speechNovember 12, 2019NCAA: San Beda one win away from reclaiming juniors basketball crownNovember 12, 2019Gov't service centers coming to 3 Robinsons Malls in Quezon CityNovember 12, 2019After nearly 3 years, authorities eye lifting Mindanao martial lawNovember 12, 2019UAAP: NU, UST share lead in men's table tennisNovember 12, 2019Immigration on lookout for gunman in broadcaster's slayNovember 12, 2019Patch Magtanong enters Miss International 2019 Top 8November 12, 2019LOOK: Patch Magtanong as Top 15 finalist in swimsuit roundNovember 12, 2019Military denies planting evidence against progressive groupsNovember 12, 2019US Supreme Court to hear Trump bid to end safeguards for immigrant 'Dreamers'November 12, 201916 dead as trains collide in BangladeshNovember 12, 2019© 2019 ABS-CBN Corporation.
