These are two short videos from a parking lot in Richmond, British Columbia of a Tesla Model 3 that was Smart Summoned by its owner from a busy street and has turned into a parking lot and is driving up a down lane trying to get to them.  *honking horn, flipping bird*  WHERE'D YOU LEARN HOW TO DRIVE, DUMBASS? *quickly rolls window up, floors it* Holy shit honey that was a ghost.Keep going for the videos while I open the floor to respectful discussion about smart summoning technology, and the people who use it.  Thanks to hairless, who agrees if a Tesla hits someone while in Smart Summon mode, who do I sue for my faked injuries?
