Nope, it's childhood nostalgia for the win, many say.Feel like you're facing over 14 million choices for your first time streaming on Disney Plus? You're not alone.There's such a thing as option paralysis. If you give a person too many choices, they may just freeze up and choose nothing. And when the new streaming service Disney Plus rolled out early Tuesday, some subscribers were feeling the pressure.Just look at the list of what's included. Marvel superhero movies! Star Wars flicks! Almost all the Pixar films! Disney princess films and other classics! New shows, like The Mandalorian! Quaint old Disney history documentaries! Disney Channel shows! It's a crazy, royal, super-powered, at times nostalgic mix."Disney Plus is everything. It has EVERYTHING. See y'all never," wrote one Twitter user.Wrote another, "Hannah. Wizards. Lizzie. I WON'T LEAVE MY HOUSE."Hannah. Wizards. Lizzie.
