Once you find one, they'll give you a special pass you can use to redeem for a bottle at one of the stores.Buy one Galaxy S10 or Note 10 and get one free at VerizonThe Galactic Hunt, as its being called, will take place on the following dates:There will be 5 secret locations each day, and as mentioned there are only 8,000 bottles waiting to be discovered.
