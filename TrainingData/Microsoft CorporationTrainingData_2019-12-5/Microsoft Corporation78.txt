On Wednesday, LeBron James committed a blatant travel that went uncalled, much to the bemusement of the Utah Jazz and their fans and the amusement of the NBA world.In the first quarter, James brought the ball past half-court, picked up his dribble with one hand, took several steps, then resumed dribbling. Somehow, the referees missed what was a travel and a double-dribble, even as Jazz guard Bojan Bogdanovic hollered about the violation."It was the worst thing, probably one of the worst things I've ever done in my career," James told reporters after the game."I think I was ready to pass the ball, and my brain just kind of just, I had a malfunction. I really had a malfunction."Here's the play:The Lakers beat the Jazz, 121-96, as James finished with 20 points and 12 assists.After the game, he also said he felt bad for the referee who missed the call because of the criticism."I feel bad for the refs on that one because they'll probably get a write-up on that or something," James said. "That was pretty bad."The NBA world has had fun with the mishap, however.And: The Proclaimers-LeBron James mash-up you didn't know you needed.
