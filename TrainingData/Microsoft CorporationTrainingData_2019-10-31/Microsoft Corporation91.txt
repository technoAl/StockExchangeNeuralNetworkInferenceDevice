As Descartes used to say: Do what you love and you’ll never work another day!We closed the day, October 31 2019, at a price of $9,199. That’s a minor 0.03 percent decline in 24 hours, or -$2.87. It was the lowest closing price in five days.We’re still 54 percent below Bitcoin‘s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $165,804,227,835. It now commands 68 percent of the total crypto market.Yesterday’s volume of $26,583,653,947 was the lowest in six days, 68 percent above the year’s average, and 41 percent below the year’s high.A total of 290,619 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 13 percent below the year’s average and 35 percent below the year’s high.Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.51.

Unfortunately for him it’s 92.8 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $127,186 by now, according to dickline.info.Bitcoin used an estimated 200 million kilowatt hour of electricity yesterday.
