A Brazilian footballer has been given a one match ban by the Ukrainian FA (UAF) for reacting to reported racial abuse directed at him during a match on Sunday. Taison, who plays for Shakhtar Donestk, raised his middle finger and kicked the ball at Dynamo Kiev fans in the 77th minute during a match on November 10, before the referee halted the game and took the players off. The 31-year-old and his teammate Dentinho, who also was targeted, left the field in tears, however upon returning five minutes later, he was shown a red card. The UAF confirmed it had upheld Taison's suspension on Thursday, according to the BBC.Kiev fans, who were warned twice during the game for racist behaviour, will not be allowed to attend their club's next match, while the club itself was fined $21,000, says the BBC.Shakhtar midfielder Marcos Antonio said after the incident: "It's terrible when such things happen in football. The game needs real fans instead of the people who come to the stadium and behave like that, not respecting the athletes."We need to work on this because such episodes upset us all."FIFPro, the world football players' union, released a statement on Thursday condemning both the Kiev fans and the UFA."We are very disappointed by the decision of the Ukrainian FA to hand Taison a one-match ban," it said, according to Sky Sports."Sanctioning a victim of racial abuse is beyond comprehension and it plays into the hands of those who promote this kind of disgraceful behavior."The UFA did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Read more:Dutch footballers plan to stand still on the pitch for the first minute of play this weekend after a player was called a 'negro' and 'cotton picker' by fansChris Smalling says football organizations are finally listening to players who have been racially abused, but Italy's latest horror show suggests otherwiseA black Dutch soccer player held his arm against his white teammate's in a powerful response to racial abuse in his home countryAn Italian youth football team plans to wear blackface as an anti-racism gesture, and it has the support of the Italian FA
