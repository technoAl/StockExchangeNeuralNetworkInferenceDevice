                    Gadgets for humansIf you are still holding on dearly to your iPhone 5 (we salute you), you need to upgrade its software immediately to keep GPS, web, and email working. According to an Apple support page, you’ll need to update your device to iOS 10.3.4 before November 3.Most modern-day devices have an in-built solution for this, so consumers don’t have to worry about anything. But some devices such as the iPhone 5 need a software update to handle it. The phone’s other functions, such as App Store, iCloud, email, and web browsing, also rely on the device showing the correct time and location. That’s why it’s critical for you to get this update for your trusty iPhone 5.For more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on
