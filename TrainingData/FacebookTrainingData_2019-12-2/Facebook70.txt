You can find even more Chromebooks on sale in Amazon's collection of Cyber Monday deals on Chromebooks.This non-touch version of the HP Chromebook 14 is a ridiculously low price for a laptop that will see Chrome OS updates until June 2026. For $120, roughly $20 a year, you can get a new laptop that's easy to use and can take a beating. If you've ever wanted to just try a Chromebook, this is the lowest barrier to entry while still getting a good screen and USB-C charging. You can even buy them in two different colors so that your kids can tell each other's apart, since Best Buy has the gray and Target has the blue.A 14 inch screen, ample port configuration, and support until June 2026 make this an absolute steal of a Chromebook, with plenty of saving left over for a nice sleeve or microSD card.If you're willing to go up another $30 to $150, Target has a touchscreen version of the HP Chromebook 14 back in stock — it sold out rather quickly yesterday — and I will always recommend springing for a Chromebook when the extra investment is this small. Tapping at the screen to play a round of Solitaire or flicking your wrist to scroll through your Twitter feed is a wonderful experience everyone should be able to enjoy, and touchscreens make interacting with Android apps easier as Android apps are optimized for touch over mouse and keyboard.Upgrade to a touchscreen while still getting great port configuration, long support life, and excellent battery in a new, name-brand Chromebook.This is the upgrade pick in our Best Chromebook roundup and the Cyber Monday deal brings it to its lowest price ever.

Even the base configuration is more than powerful enough for this power-user.If you're looking for a Chromebook to give your kid but you know they tend to break things, Lenovo has you covered this Cyber Monday. There haven't been any real discounts on education Chromebooks except for the Lenovo 500e Chromebook, which works out just perfectly because this is gives you the same internals and stylus as our favorite Chromebook for Students, the ASUS Chromebook Flip C214, for $150 less, while still giving you Lenovo's great build quality and better keyboard.Made to take a beating in the classroom, this Chromebook is a great choice for roughhousing kids and danger-prone adults. The included stylus is a great bonus for note-taking and sketching, too.The Acer Spin 11 is being offered for $300 as part of Amazon's Gold Box deal, but if you really wat to get a deal, head over to Best Buy instead, where you can save an extra $80 on a great compact Chromebook with support for external EMR styluses and will get Chrome OS updates until June 2024.

My faith was rewarded as the 64GB configuration of the C340 is indeed on sale for $230, but you'll need a Costco membership to go get it.

This is the 4GB/32GB version, which should be able to handle long multi-tasking sessions with grace, and the touchscreen will make it far, far easier to interact with games and Android apps. Should the deal on this configuration run out — or should you want a little more storage — a 64GB model is also available from Best Buy for $280 and I highly encourage getting extra storage if you can so that you have more room for installing Android apps.With a long support life and a nice shiny touchscreen, this Chromebook is ready to work and play all day with 12 hours of battery life on a single charge.Both Dell and Best Buy have the Inspiron 14 2-in-1 on sale for the best price we've seen so far, and if you prefer Dell's durable build quality and bright 1080p screen, this is a great time to pull the trigger.

You'll want to carry it all-day every day unless you've got a light backpack with thick foam straps, but for around the house or enshrined at the office, this is a nice big Chromebook without a nice big price tag.This is one of the few Chromebook models with a number pad on its keyboard, and with an i3 processor, 128GB of storage, and a 15.6-inch touchscreen, this machine is ready for grading term papers or super-sized solitaire.Chromebooks are laptops that run Chrome OS, an operating system designed and managed by Google. It's the more polished and stable version of the open-source Chromium Project, which Google also develops and maintains. There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding Chrome OS because it began as a web-centric client that couldn't do much when outside of a Wi-Fi network, but this doesn't hold true anymore. These days, Chrome OS can run both Android apps and Linux apps, allowing it to do most if not all of the tasks you'd need to do on a laptop day-to-day.What makes Chromebooks especially enticing is that Chrome OS is optimized to run well even on lower-spec'd machines. While most Windows laptops under $400 will feel and perform like pudding after six months, even $250 Chromebooks like the Lenovo C330 still run just as well as they did fresh out of the box. This also means that when you put Chrome OS on a more powerful Chromebook like the Intel M3-powered Asus C434 or the i5-powered Pixelbook, you get a lightning-fast computer that can handle all the Chrome tabs and Android apps you could throw at it.Chromebooks are becoming more and more popular in schools and businesses because of how well Chrome OS runs on value machines, as well as how stable, and secure Chrome OS is. Google hosts a bounty program that pays developers when they discover and submit vulnerabilities to be patched, including a $150,000 standing bounty for a vulnerability that can compromise a Chromebook while in Guest Mode. Chromebooks also get updated every few weeks directly from Google, meaning that no matter which brand Chromebook you buy, they'll all look, act, and get updates the same way.For people who mainly use a laptop to read emails, check social media, pay your bills, write the occasional screenplay in Google Docs, and blow time watching videos, a Chromebook is perfect. Chromebooks are great for work or play so long as your services either have a website or an Android app, which in 2019 is pretty standard. I've been working full-time on a Chromebook for two years, and the only thing I ever miss is full Photoshop for batch photo editing my review photos.What I honestly love best about my Chromebook is that it's an "it just works" computer with absolutely zero maintenance. Updates are downloaded and installed automatically in the background while you work, and Google Play handles app updates. The Files app ties directly into Google Drive, you can keep everything synced and work out of the cloud, but you can still keep your files offline in Downloads for when you need to finish that book report on the bus to school.Chromebooks are especially great for younger users for several reasons, including but not limited to:Chromebooks can't install traditional programs to the core system — like you would on a Mac or Windows PC — but they can install Android apps via the Google Play Store. While not every single app on Google Play is compatible with Chromebooks, there are millions of apps you can install, from productivity apps like Microsoft Office and Google Keep to entertainment apps like Netflix and Disney+ to millions of gaming apps.Chromebooks are the easiest laptops to download videos for offline playback for services like Disney+ and Google Play Movies that don't have desktop apps for Mac or Windows but do have Android apps. The Android apps allow you to download videos just like you would on your phone, but enjoy them on a larger screen without killing your phone's battery on that cross-country flight.Most games available on Android are available on Chromebook, so you'll be able to enjoy most casual gaming on your Chromebook with ease. In fact, if you're coming from a Windows computer, you'll even be able to keep your favorite game: Microsoft Solitaire Collection works great on Chromebooks and helps me get a quick fix when my Pyramids addiction flares up.What about Fortnite? Steam games? PC games? Chromebooks can't install Windows or MacOS programs, and the ability to install Linux apps like Steam isn't available for every Chromebook — nor are Linux apps on Chromebooks as user-friendly as Android apps. Gaming options on a Chromebook are getting better, but it's not what you're going to want to get a hardcore gamer.There are five things you need to consider any time you're looking to buy a Chromebook, and there are two features you especially need to pay attention to during Cyber Monday when Chromebooks of every size, shape, and age are on sale.
