Celebrity manager Scooter Braun posted a quote on his Instagram that read, "Kindness is the only response," amid his very public disagreement with Taylor Swift about her old music. In the caption, he said they were "words to live by."A post shared by  Scooter Braun (@scooterbraun) on Nov 18, 2019 at 11:41pm PSTNov 18, 2019 at 11:41pm PST
Braun and Scott Borchetta bought the label Big Machine Records earlier this year in a $300 million sale that included Swift's first six albums that she left behind when she switched to Universal Music Group in 2018. At the time, Swift said of the purchase: "All I could think about was the incessant, manipulative bullying I've received at his hands for years."She was referring to the situation surrounding her ongoing feud with Kanye West, who was managed by Braun, about his music video for "Famous" which she believed was derogatory. She also referenced Justin Bieber, another of Braun's clients, getting involved."Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it," Swift said.On November 14, Swift tweeted that she didn't "know what else to do" because Braun and Borchetta were blocking her from performing her old songs at the AMAs.She said she was going to perform "a medley of my hits throughout the decade on the show," but claimed that Braun and Borchetta wouldn't allow it as it "would be re-recording my music before I'm allowed to next year."She also alleged that Brain and Borchetta "declined the use of my older music or performance footage for this project, even though there is no mention of either of them or Big Machine Records anywhere in the film," and asked her fans "to talk some sense into the men who are exercising control."Several celebrities, including Selena Gomez and Gigi Hadid, have since spoken out in support of Swift.Big Machine Records soon denied the claims Swift made. However, Swift's spokesperson shared a letter with Insider dated October 28, 2019, that appeared to show Swift was prevented from performing her old songs.Read more:A board member for Big Machine Records tells Taylor Swift to 'stop lying' in her feud with Scooter BraunKim Kardashian casually listened to another one of Taylor Swift's songs months after the reality TV star declared she's 'over' their feudTaylor Swift said she's 'sad and grossed out' that 'bully' Scooter Braun now owns all of her past musicFans are furious that Scooter Braun posted that he 'bought' Taylor Swift, and the pop star has been quietly liking their angry posts15 of the best and 15 of the worst Taylor Swift songs of all timeLike what you see here?
