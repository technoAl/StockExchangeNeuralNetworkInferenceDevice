Disney launched its new streaming platform Disney Plus on Tuesday, bringing Disney into the streaming wars against the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime.The launch was heavily promoted across all types of media but received some odd and somewhat confusing plugs from reporters at ESPN, including NFL insider Adam Schefter and NBA insider Adrian Wojnarowski."Big day for the new Disney+ service," wrote Schefter. "It will change lives."Other ESPN personalities also tweeted about their excitement for the new streaming service, including Stephen A. Smith, Matthew Berry, and John Buccigross.Schefter, Wojnarowski, and Smith have a combined 15.8 million followers on Twitter, making their co-signing of the service no small favor but rather a hefty dose of advertising.On Twitter, some took issue with the blurring of journalistic lines, while others joked at the degree to which Schefter had hyped the streaming service.Not everyone took issue with the tweets. Richard Deitsch, who covers sports media for The Athletic, suggested the mass promotion came along with being a part of a company, though said that adding a "#ad" might have helped things come across a bit more smoothly. As ESPN's parent company, it's not surprising that Disney would heavily advertise its new service on the Worldwide Leader in Sports, and fans watching "Monday Night Football" were treated to plenty of teases regarding the streaming platform.Still, the promotion of Disney Plus by ESPN employees, especially the likes of Schefter and Wojnarowski who are news-breakers and journalists rather than strictly commentators, raises some questions regarding whether or not those that tweeted an endorsement of the new service were instructed to do so, or compensated for their promotion.According to Deitsch, the tweets in support of Disney Plus were not contractually obligated. In a statement to Business Insider, ESPN VP of communications Josh Krulewitz said of Disney Plus, "It is a major company initiative, and as part of that we provided accurate and useful information to our people, so that if they chose, they were able to inform fans about available content and products."'Monday Night Football' commentator under fire after belittling criticism of 49ers kicker for missed field goalTop 14 waiver-wire pickups for Week 11 of fantasy footballOnly 11 schools still have a legit shot to make the College Football PlayoffPatriots rookie is saving and investing 90% of his paychecks so he can 'live like a prince' for the rest of his life
