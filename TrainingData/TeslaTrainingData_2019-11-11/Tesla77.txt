Officials, however, say cycle paths will be extended to cover 750 kilometers by 2025.Following the announcement, regional ride-sharing giant Grab said it was suspending its scooter-sharing set-up in Singapore while the government said it would reject applications by other firms hoping to start such services.Singapore is just the latest country trying to get control of the scooters.Last week, the French government issued new rules, including a ban on using them on pavements — unless a city permits them in certain areas — and a 25 kilometer per hour speed limit.Germany does not allow them on pavements while London has taken the most extreme approach of major European cities, prohibiting the two-wheelers entirely unless a rider has a driving license, insurance, road tax, a helmet, and a number plate.The hardest hit in Singapore by the new rules is the army of people using e-scooters to deliver food across the city for companies such as Deliveroo, Grab and Foodpanda, although authorities have taken steps to help.Tesla delivers record number of electric carsOn Friday, the transport ministry said the government and companies were offering grants for e-scooter delivery riders to switch to other devices including regular and power-assisted bicycles.Benjamin Goh has already changed to a bike for his food delivery job — but said his income would be affected as cycling is more exhausting, meaning he can complete fewer orders.“It’s very tiring for me to use a bicycle,” said the 26-year-old single father, adding that he would also end up fatigued and potentially less capable of caring for his young son after work.Goh said he felt food delivery workers were being punished for the bad behavior of some recreational riders but conceded: “I can understand why people hate us.”The scooter clean-up patrol is one byproduct of a global explosion in shared electric scootersAmount to be invested in mobility and other auto technologies by 2025Says stakeholders’ consent was not sought before approval of policy
