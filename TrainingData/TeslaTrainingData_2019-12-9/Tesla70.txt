Even though fewer students are applying for US MBA programs, demand for graduates is as high as ever. Just look at where the majority of MBA students from the third best business school in the country, the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, ended up after graduation.Booth released data this week on the 23 employers that hired over half of the class of 2019. These employers reflect the three industries that drew most grads: consulting, finance, and technology. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these are quite lucrative industries, with the highest reported median salaries. You can read a report on the salary breakdown for the graduating class by industry here. These are the companies that hired at least four graduates each from Booth's latest class, listed in order of least to most graduates hired. Number of Hires: 4Percent of Hires: 0.8%Number of Hires: 4Percent of Hires: 0.8%Number of Hires: 4Percent of Hires: 0.8%Number of Hires: 4Percent of Hires: 0.8%Number of Hires: 4Percent of Hires: 0.8%Number of Hires: 4Percent of Hires: 0.8%Number of Hires: 4Percent of Hires: 0.8%Number of Hires: 5Percent of Hires: 1.0%Number of Hires: 6Percent of Hires: 1.2%Number of Hires: 6Percent of Hires: 1.2%Number of Hires: 6Percent of Hires: 1.2%Number of Hires: 6Percent of Hires: 1.2%Number of Hires: 6Percent of Hires: 1.2%Number of Hires: 7Percent of Hires: 1.4%Number of Hires: 7Percent of Hires: 1.4%Number of Hires: 8Percent of Hires: 1.7%Number of Hires: 9Percent of Hires: 1.9%Number of Hires: 11Percent of Hires: 2.3%Number of Hires: 14Percent of Hires: 2.9%Number of Hires: 23Percent of Hires: 4.8%Number of Hires: 26Percent of Hires: 5.4%Number of Hires: 35Percent of Hires: 7.2%Number of Hires: 48Percent of Hires: 9.9%
