According to Yahoo Sports, the pair started dating when Mahomes was in 10th grade. After Matthews graduated in 2013, she went on to play college soccer at the nearby University of Texas at Tyler, while Mahomes, who graduated in 2014, went to Texas Tech University — 440 miles away in Lubbock — to play college football and baseball.

Matthews, meanwhile, graduated with a kinesiology degree, and signed to play soccer professionally with UMF Afturelding/Fram in Iceland in May 2017."Every coach I have had at UT Tyler made a huge impact on my love for this game and my decision to play professional soccer," Matthews told the Morning Telegraph. "An opportunity opened up for me in Iceland and I could never pass up such an amazing experience to go do what I love."It's unclear how long Matthews lived in Iceland, but it appears to be less than a year. Her team won its league in September 2017, according to Matthews' Instagram, and by October 2017 she was in Kansas City.

Mahomes told USA Today: "The fans come out every single week and show passion and love for us and our team and what we're doing here, so for me, I want to be back in the community, giving back. And just be a part of it, to show the same love and passion to them."Though Mahomes experienced a hand injury this season, he's optimistic about his future with the team, which has a record of 9-4 in the current season. "It doesn't feel great right now, but it's something that you play with," Mahomes said in a post-game press conference about his hand injury. "In this sport, you're going to bang something. So for me, it's about going out there and competing and relying on my teammates to help me out whenever I'm not feeling 100 percent."
