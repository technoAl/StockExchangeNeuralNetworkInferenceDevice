An anonymous woman has gone viral for sharing her money diary on Refinery29.The 33-year-old surgeon who lives with her husband in Washington, DC, has set tongues wagging online after revealing how she spends her money, dropping $2,000 on a dress when she couldn't find anything to wear for her husband's Christmas party, $1,528 on "a few pretty things from La Perla" (lingerie), and spending $1,400 a month on dog day care.The woman and her husband, known only as "K," have a combined income of $655,000 — $515,000 of which is earned by the surgeon. Both are eligible for bonuses, too.Unlike many millennials, the couple own their property — a four bedroom, four bathroom townhouse — having inherited money from the woman's great grandparents. All they have to pay property-wise is a monthly $1,000 tax and then $300-400 on utilities.Another factor that makes the surgeon's situation unusual is that she has zero student debt to pay off: "My parents covered my undergrad and med school tuition," she said.All this means the couple has a fair amount of disposable income to play with.They contribute $3,000 a month "to the family office for directed giving," although it is unclear what this means, spend $750 a year in boat club dues, $690 on "season tickets to an experimental theatre company in DC" annually, $352.12 together for their monthly gym memberships, $800 a month on laundry and cleaning, and $83 a year in total for their sorority and fraternity dues.The woman also shared her spending diary for a week, which included:She also detailed her skincare regime (the morning routine alone consists of Fresh Soy Face Cleansing Milk, Pixi Glow Tonic, Thayers Rose Water Toner, Drunk Elephant Vitamin C Serum, La Solution 10 De Chanel, Bare Republic Tinted Sunscreen, mascara, and PawPaw Lip Balm), has a penchant for shopping in Whole Foods, and appears to love eating out and travelling (they're going to Japan in December and "rely on the Amex concierge to do most of the planning.")The couple are also generous, though — the woman says she is surprising her sister's children (12 and 16) with a skiing trip to Utah complete with business class flights ($3,000 in total).All in all, she spent $8,391.29 over the course of the week, with more than half of that ($4,716.14) going on clothes and beauty.Reactions to the spending diary have been mixed — while some have expressed shock at the woman's lavish lifestyle, others have commended her for working hard."I've spent more time than I need to with my mouth agape due to this money diary," tweeted journalist Reina Sultan. "This is what it's like to both make a s---load of money AND have family money," wrote publicist Heather Job.When Refinery29 shared the diary on Facebook, however, there were more complimentary comments. "Considering her income, I'm honestly surprised her spending is as low as it is," wrote a woman named Maggie Harris."I know a lot of professionals who have similar clothing expenses PLUS housekeeping and lots of take out, dining out or personal chef expenses. Her expenses show that she puts her money into quality items, experiences with her husband and family, and memberships that she actually uses."Facebook user JL Anne added: "Good for her. She worked hard to get where she is, but it must've been nice having tuition and school covered by her parents."She must've powered through med school and her residency to already be a practicing surgeon!"Read more:I went to 6 weddings this summer.
